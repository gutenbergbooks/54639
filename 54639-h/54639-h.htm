  <ul  class='ul_1'>
    <li>Obvious typos and punctuation errors corrected. Spelling of names Lamarck and
    Bruguière standardized, otherwise variations in spelling, capitalization and hyphenation
    retained.
    </li>
    <li>“var” is sometimes italicized, other times not. It has been kept as printed.
    </li>
    <li>Corrections printed in the text as a note to THE BINDER have been made. In addition,
    plates 19 and 20 were reversed in the original. These plates have been swapped so that
    the correct image precedes the chapter that discusses it.
    </li>
    <li>Missing title text “PLATE VI” added at the start of its chapter.
    </li>
    <li>Missing entry for Plate 36 in the Index has been added. “Polita, Nerita, var;
    Pink-Banded Variety of the Thick Polished Nerit 36”
    </li>
    <li>There are entries in the Index that don’t seem to correspond to specific text in the
    related plate chapter, but may refer to a plant that is in the plate background.
    </li>
    <li>The author uses asterisks in varying numbers in front of some descriptive text at the
    beginning of plate chapters. There are also a couple of asterisks within the text that
    appear similar to footnote indicators, but a corresponding footnote does not seem to
    exist. These asterisks have been left in the text in their original location.
    </li>
    <li>If the device allows, plate images may be clicked upon to load a larger version.
    </li>
    <li>The cover has been created by the transcriber from elements in the book and is placed
    in the public domain.

</div>

<p class='c005'>The Twelfth Number of this work is now respectfully submitted to
the attention of the public. This number, accompanied by the Title Page
and Index, renders the first volume complete. The Subscribers, therefore,
are now enabled to form a correct idea of the nature and object of the
undertaking: and from the style in which it has been so far conducted,
to form some conclusion of that in which it is likely for the future to be
continued.</p>

<p class='c006'>The general approbation that has been bestowed already upon this
publication can be best appreciated from the extent of sale, which, to say
the least, has been respectable from the commencement, notwithstanding
that the undertaking was began under the manifest disadvantage of being
little known, and the very knowledge of its existence being still in no small
degree circumscribed. It is not, therefore, without a sense of grateful
feeling that the author has observed that besides the incidental sale of the
different detached or monthly parts selected by purchasers desirous of the
plates and descriptions of some particular object of rarity, that the number
of regular subscribers, instead of diminishing, has rapidly advanced with
the publication of each number in succession, and as it seems to appear
in proportion as the public became better acquainted with its merits, and
the more assured of its uninterrupted continuance. While this testimony
of approbation prevails, the author of this undertaking will be duly
stimulated to exert his best means of rendering it deserving of their consideration.
Nor has he any hesitation in believing that it will be in his
power, under the auspices of public favour, to produce a work of much
elegance, and no mean utility, either as a work of taste for the library of
the general reader, or the admirer of nature; the folios of the amateur, or
the professed Study of the experienced Naturalist.</p>

<p class='c006'>The commencement of this work was necessarily preceded by a few
observations upon the nature and object of the undertaking: those observations
are no less appropriate on the present occasion than the former,
and for this reason we shall again advert to them in restating the intention
the author has in view. The <span class='sc'>Naturalist’s Repository</span>, or <span class='sc'>Monthly
Miscellany of Exotic Natural History</span>, is designed to comprehend
in the most commodious form, a miscellaneous assemblage of elegantly
coloured plates, with appropriate scientific and general descriptions of the
most curious, scarce, and beautiful productions of nature that have been
recently discovered in various parts of the world or may hereafter occur to
the notice of the author; and more especially of such novelties as from
their extreme rarity remain entirely undescribed, or which have not been
duly noticed by any preceding Naturalist.</p>

<p class='c006'>Most readers, it is presumed, will be aware that the labours of the
authors life, during a course of many years have been directed to the pursuits
of natural science: labours not confined to any one particular branch
or department of the varied face of nature, but extending generally to the
whole. The endeavours of the author to elucidate the Natural History of
the British Isles are sufficiently known from the various extensive works
which have been produced by him during the course of the last thirty years,
and the magnitude which those works have at length acquired in the
progressive course of publication that had been adopted, is the best
criterion of the approbation that has attended them. But it is not within
the views of the author in this place to expatiate upon a subject which
might be deemed irrelevant, the works alluded to being devoted solely to
the productions of our native country, while the avowed object of the
present undertaking is to comprehend a selection of those only which are
peculiar to foreign, and with few exceptions, to extra European climates.
The chief motive of the author in adverting to those works, is to point
out a style and mode of execution for the present undertaking, which,
from the very extensive patronage those former labours of the author
have experienced, may be considered applicable in a very peculiar degree
to every purpose of correct elucidation, and as one most likely to ensure
by its elegance and perfection that same proportion of general approbation
which the other productions of the author have obtained.</p>

<p class='c006'>With respect to the means within the author’s power of rendering
this work deserving of the public notice, either as to the novelty, variety,
rarity, or beauty of the various objects it is destined to embrace, the
author must rather trust to the favourable opinion which the world may
entertain in its behalf, from the examples now submitted to consideration,
than to any preliminary observations he can offer: he shall only presume
respectfully that they are adequate to the purpose, and calculated to
answer every moderate expectation his preliminary observations may
have excited.</p>

<p class='c006'>It will be readily conceived that the opportunities of the author’s life,
so assiduously devoted to the Science of Nature, must have enabled him
to enrich his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>port feuilles</i></span> with a collection of <span class='sc'>Drawings</span>, <span class='sc'>Manuscripts</span>,
and <span class='sc'>Memoranda</span> of no mean importance in all its branches. This is
perfectly correct. His own Museum confined chiefly, but not exclusively,
to the productions of Great Britain, have afforded many rarities, the
offspring of foreign climates, which could not elsewhere be procured. But
independently of those resources which his own collection has afforded,
his other means have been amply extensive. Through the kindness of
his scientific friends, he has had unlimited access to many other collections
of acknowledged moment, for the purpose of enriching his Collectanea
with drawings and descriptions of the more interesting rarities which those
cabinets respectively contained. Some of those collections exist no longer
and are probably now forgotten, but the memory of others, even among
the number of those which have passed away, will ever be cherished with
regret in the mind of every man of science by whom their merits were
understood. The preservation even of the memorials of some minor
portion of the rarities which those collections once embodied can scarcely
fail to prove of interest at the present day, while their total loss to the
rising generation will be in some degree appreciated from the memoranda
and occasional references that will appear respecting them in the progress
of the present work: to enumerate the many collections of private individuals,
the rarities of which have contributed to render this collection of
the author’s drawings important, would extend our advertisement far
beyond our intended limits. It may be sufficient to observe that the late
Leverian Museum, rich in every branch of Natural History, has tended
in an eminent degree to this effect; the author having been favoured with
unreserved permission to take drawings and memoranda of whatever
he deemed important, besides having subsequently enriched his own
Museum with a very ample portion of that fine collection, by public
purchase, at the time of its dispersion; particularly in the different tribes
of the Mammiferous animals, in Ornithology, Ichthyology, and various
others; and also with every object materially important among the extraneous
fossils which that splendid museum originally contained. It will be
also seen from many of our pages that through the kindness of the late
worthy President of the Royal Society, Sir Joseph Banks, the rich
and truly scientific collection of that munificent patron of the sciences
was ever open to us for the furtherance of our pursuits in Natural History;
and of the object of the present work among others. The collections of
Mr. Drury, and also that of Mr. Francillon, in the particular branches of
Entomology, are too considerable to be passed slightly over: the rarities
of both these collections have in an eminent degree improved our means of
rendering this work important. And lastly we may mention among other
scientific acquisitions the Collectanea of drawings formed by the pencil of
the late Mr. Jones of Chelsea, together with the manuscripts of Fabricius
in elucidation, as a treasure which cannot be too highly appreciated when
we recollect the importance of the Fabrician writings on the continent,
and remember also that those drawings afford the only illustration of the
most splendid portion of the insect race which that author exclusively
describes, and by which very many of the species can alone be now
determined.</p>

<p class='c006'>In conclusion of these remarks it may be observed, however, that
while in our elucidation of those rarities which the collections and museums
above adverted to have so amply afforded, we render a deserved tribute
of record to the liberality of those whose services in the cause of Natural
History have so amply contributed to its advancement in former days, the
author will not remain unmindful of those advantages which the many
valuable collections of the present period offer. It will appear as this
work proceeds that he is in no small degree indebted to the favor of many
eminent scientific characters of our time, as well as those who have
preceded them, for their permission to take drawings and descriptions of
such rarities in their collections as really appear worthy of distinct
consideration. And it may be added finally that he shall at all times
avail himself with pleasure, and acknowledge with thanks, any further
advantages of the same kind which the favours of others may be induced
to allow for the purpose of enriching the present undertaking.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c006'>Were it within the contemplation of our present views to enter
into the ancient history of the science of Conchology, we should
be under little difficulty in demonstrating upon the authority of the
best informed historians as well as ancient classics that it has a claim
to very remote antiquity. The study of Shells prevailed, at least
to some extent, in those early times when the generality of mankind
believe the world to have been buried in the depths of ignorance.
At periods, even when some among those of better information may be
inclined to imagine that the ancients could have had no very accurate
conceptions of the nature of these bodies, or of their classification,
natural or artificial, and even when it might be supposed from the
warlike temper of the age the collecting of shells would have been
deemed an unworthy occupation, we discover sufficient indications
to prove that their leisure hours were so employed. The productions
of the sea were delineated in their manuscripts; Pliny speaks
of the delight the artist took in painting the asterias, or sea stars.
The spontaneous offerings of the ocean were depicted in their
natural colours upon the walls of their dwellings, abundant evidence
of which appears among the ancient paintings of Herculaneum and
Pompeii; and that the shells themselves were sometimes collected
by the ancients is placed beyond a doubt from those remains which
have been found, at various times, among the relics of those celebrated
ruins, and also among the ruins of the Roman town, perhaps
no less ancient, denominated La Scava.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is declared by Pliny, in the ninth book of his Natural History,
that the Romans of his time were better acquainted with the
productions of the sea than the animals of the land, a circumstance
he attributes, and unquestionably with sufficient reason, to the extravagant
excess to which the luxurious taste of those times was
carried. This will excite the less surprise when we recollect the
various useful results deduced from this investigation. Of these
we have several very memorable examples; the exquisite dyes of
green, the scarlet, and the imperial purple, which they possessed
and prized so eminently, were all the produce of testaceous bodies.
And so likewise the pearls gathered from the various perlaceous bivalve
shells; and pearls we are assured were in those days valued at
Rome, as in Egypt, at a price infinitely beyond that of gold and gems,
the diamond alone excepted.</p>

<p class='c006'>Pliny tells us, that, in his time, after the diamonds of India and
Arabia, pearls were esteemed most precious, and that we may be
under no error as to the application of the text to the pearls found
in shells, he further adds, that he had before spoken of these pearls
in his book that treats upon the productions of the sea<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>. The
diamonds in those times were so scarce, and esteemed so highly, as
to be little known, except among princes, the smaller and most inferior
kinds alone excepted. The pearls were the most costly jewels employed
in the ornaments for the ears, the neck, and fingers of the
fair sex, and the shells themselves were converted into various
articles of finery for their wardrobe and furniture.</p>

<p class='c006'>But it is not, as before observed, within our province in this
place, to enter into any such latitude of explanation as an ample
illustration of these remarks may be conceived to merit. It is our
object only to express ourselves in general terms: it may be sufficient
therefore to observe, that among the luxuries of the great in the times
of Pliny, Oppian, and Juvenal, it is certain they indulged their
peculiar taste in the study of these productions of the deep. They
not only amassed together the more curious among those shells
whose beauty attracted their regard, they entered also to some extent
into their history and manners, and were sufficiently informed
as to their natural properties to render them subservient to the
general purposes of luxury and life. They knew the distinctions
between the land, the fresh-water, and the marine tribes of shells,
and they proceeded with minuteness and sometimes fully into their
history. No classic reader of the Halieutics of Oppian will doubt
the general acquaintance of the ancients with those beings in their
native element, nor will any one imagine, who is conversant with
the lives of the philosophers of the infant ages of the world, that the
study of Conchology, even as a science, was unknown. So many
writings of the ancients, even of the classic ages of Greece and Rome,
have disappeared, that it may be now impossible to form any very
accurate conclusions, at the same time that enough remains to justify
our persuasion that it was far from inconsiderable. Among
others, the works of Aristotle, the preceptor of the Macedonian
conqueror Alexander, have survived the ravages of time, and very
happily, for the history of human knowledge unfolds to us the views
which the ancients had then taken of natural science, and among
the rest of the science of Conchology; and there is, moreover,
every reason to believe that in the classification of the testaceous
tribes, or shells, which the writings of this philosopher present us,
we, in reality, possess the arrangement of the shells composing the
Conchological collection of that most potent monarch, the conqueror
of the world:—the classical distribution of the shells of the great
Alexander, as they were disposed by the most celebrated naturalist
of his age, and at a period more remote than three centuries before
the commencement of the Christian æra.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Science of Conchology, like that of all other branches of
nature, has undergone its mutations at various periods. Generally,
it has held a rank of some eminence, a circumstance attributable
no doubt to the peculiar beauty of this interesting tribe. In speaking
of the latter times, the period of the last and preceding centuries,
it would be difficult to determine in which country of civilized Europe
the science of Conchology has been most esteemed; at one time,
the virtuosi of Holland, at another of France, and latterly of Britain,
have endeavoured to produce the most extensive and costly cabinets
of Conchology, and each in consequence may perhaps have excelled
alternately; nor were other countries of Europe in this respect less
emulous, or materially deficient in the number and excellence of
their collections in this department of nature, during the same
periods.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have been unavoidably led into this train of digression and
remark from a due consideration of the very interesting history
connected with the shells which form the subject of the annexed
Plate, the particulars of which, it is presumed, will be found to justify
the general tendency of these observations, and these remarks
may be considered also as a prelude to the introduction of many
others among the number of those rarities which it is within our
contemplation to produce progressively in the course of the present
work; shells, to which the prevalence of general taste has assigned
a value and importance scarcely less considerable than the nonpareil
cones, or the eminently celebrated cedo nulli.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first shell in the plate before us that invites attention from
its magnitude is that superb cone delineated at figure I. This shell,
which once held a distinguished place in the Leverian Museum, is
two inches and six-eighths in length, its greatest breadth one inch
and three-eighths. The general colour pale yellowish, with two
bands of chesnut, marked with irregular arrow-headed spots of
white, and an intermediate narrow band composed of white spots of
the same form, each connected by means of an intervening dot of
chesnut, which, together, form a catenated band of peculiar elegance.
When very closely examined with the aid of a magnifier, the whole
surface of the shell appears finely reticulated with yellow.</p>

<p class='c006'>This shell was sold in one of the latter day’s sale of the Leverian
Museum for the sum of five guineas and a half.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><span class='large'>FIGURE II.</span> <br /> <br /> CONUS AMMIRALIS var AMBOINENSIS β.<br /> <br /> SIX-BANDED AMBOYNA HIGH-SPIRED<br /> ADMIRAL SHELL.</h3>

<p class='c012'>Spire high and tapering; shell subpyriform; smooth, pale yellowish,
sprinkled with fulvous; body-wreath with six bands, the three
uppermost linear, and composed of alternate white and chesnut-coloured
dots, the three lower of two broad castaneous bands, marked
with subsaggitate oval spots, and an intermediate narrow belt of alternate
brown and white dots.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c006'>This shell, like the former, (fig. I) constituted part of the Leverian
collection of exotic shells. Its length is an inch and half, its greatest
breadth exceeding five-eighths of an inch.</p>

<p class='c006'>Notwithstanding the inferiority of its size, this very elegant and
curious shell is not less interesting than the preceding. The general
tints in both are nearly the same, but in the present shell are
rather deeper, the dots of fulvous brighter and more thickly sprinkled,
and the bands more numerous. Like the former shell it has two
broad bands of brown, checquered with subovate spots of white, and
an intermediate dotted line, but these are placed rather nearer
towards the narrower end of the shell, and the intervening space
between the spire and the larger band, encompassed or girt round
with two other linear bands, composed of white and brown dots,
besides another still more conspicuous, and composed of larger spots
along the base or body-wreath, contiguous to the spire or turban.</p>

<p class='c006'>This little shell may be considered as affording an excellent
type of one of the rarer kinds of Conus Ammiralis, the variety denominated
the Six-banded high-spired Admiral Cone. During a
period of some years that have now elapsed since the dispersion of
that collection, no other example of this variety has occurred to our
observation more perfect and characteristic in all its markings.</p>

<p class='c012'>Spire high and tapering; marbled white, fulvous, and dusky;
body-wreath with three subolivaceous bands, the broadest towards
the spire, with four belts of whitish dots; the two others towards
the narrow end each with a single row of dots.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c006'>If in the preceding instances we have produced some novelties
worthy of particular attention, the present shell, in point of value
as well as beauty, must also lay a distinguished claim to our consideration.
This is one of those rare varieties of Conus Ammiralis
denominated the <span class='sc'>Cedo Nulli</span>, or <span class='sc'>Cedo Nulli</span> <i>pretiossissimus</i>,
in allusion to the incomparable value affixed to the varieties of this
peculiar species. The importance attached to the shells of this
kind may indeed be best conceived by stating that some of its
varieties have been valued at twenty, fifty, and one hundred guineas;
one, in almost every respect resembling that delineated at figure 4,
the celebrated Cedo Nulli of Lyonet’s cabinet, was valued by Lyonet
himself, about the year 1732, at three hundred guineas; and
either this shell, or another very similar to it, actually realized a
sum of 1200 florins.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the shells of this kind may very justly be presumed to be of
the first rarity, every trait of information that may appear calculated
to elucidate their history, it is presumed, will not only be permitted
but be deemed acceptable, and under this impression the ensuing observations
are submitted.</p>

<p class='c006'>Much about the æra of the first explosion of the French Revolution
of 1789, and within the space of a few years after, it is
perfectly well known that many of the choicest cabinets and collections
of rarities that had before been the pride of France and
Holland were consigned to this country for the sake of safety, and
being in some instances afterwards dispersed, had tended, in no
small degree, to enrich the cabinets of our own country. It was at
this period that many very rare shells occurred to our observation
which have since disappeared, and among others, several of those
varieties of Cedo nulli which had been before held in other parts of
Europe in considerable estimation. In the year 1797 we saw no
less than five specimens of this rare shell, all varying a little from
each other, in the cabinet of the French Minister of State, M. de
Calonne; in one, the colour was pale, in another deeper, one was
lineated, and another distinguished by having three distinct bands.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the dispersion of the Calonnian Museum, which took place
by public sale rather more than twenty years ago, the series of
these valuable shells passed into the fine collection of the present
Earl Tankerville, a collection his lordship was then forming for the
pleasure of an amiable and beloved daughter since deceased, and
these shells are still considered among the more choice rarities of
that valuable cabinet.</p>

<p class='c006'>The shell, however, more immediately under our consideration,
the variety, delineated at figure 3, is from another source; it was
among the spoils of rarities sent over to this country from Holland,
at the time of the insurrection connected with the first inroads of
the French into that country. The shell passed into the hands of a
merchant of curiosities in London, and being afterwards sold, its
destination is uncertain; the price affixed was twenty guineas.</p>

<p class='c006'>This shell corresponded very nearly with the variety denominated
Seba’s Cedo nulli, having once formed a part of the museum
of the celebrated Seba, but it could not be the same, because the
entire collection of Seba, which at the period of the French invasion
constituted part of the Royal Museum of the Stadtholder, was
carried into France and its contents distributed among the other
objects of natural history in the French Museum<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a>. The description
which Favanne has left us of the <span class='sc'>Cedo nulli De Seba</span> is in the
following words, and will be found on a near comparison to accord
pretty accurately with our present shell:—“<i>Le Cedo nulli</i> de
Seba, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à large bande citron foncé, chargée de quatre cordelettes de
grains inégaux, blancs, bleus, rouges et orangés. Le reste de sa
robe est fascié et marbré d’orangé-brun, de jaune, de rouge et bleu-pâle
sur un fond blanc avec deux bandes grenues vers le bas.</span>”</p>

<div class='c016'><span class='sc'>Favanne</span>, t. ii. p. 422.</div>

<h3 class='c011'><span class='large'>FIGURE IV.</span> <br /> <br /> CONUS AMMIRALIS var CEDO NULLI β.<br /> <br /> FULVOUS NONPAREIL CONE.</h3>

<p class='c012'>Spire high and tapering, fulvous reddish and orange, varied
and marbled with white; two orange bands, each with four belts of
white dots, and a single series near the tip.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c006'>The shell from which this drawing is taken fell also into the
possession of the same individual as the last, and much about same
period. This rarity was disposed of, as I have been informed, at a
price exceeding that of the former, and passed shortly after, I believe,
into the Imperial cabinet, at Vienna, or otherwise into one of the
continental cabinets in the north of Europe, a circumstance we have
not, at this distant period, any means whatever of determining.</p>

<p class='c006'>The accordance between this shell and the celebrated Cedo
nulli of Lyonet’s cabinet, which, as before intimated, was estimated
at the value of three hundred guineas, will not escape the remark
those who are acquainted with the description of Lyonet’s shell.
According to Favanne there were two or more varieties of the
Cedo nulli, in his time, in France, that bore a very near resemblance
to the shell of Lyonet; he speaks of one in the cabinet of Madame
La Presidente de Bandeville, which differed in its marbling of
white: in being larger and more prolonged upon the top of the first
whorl, ather larger, and interrupted with veins of orange, and the
last of the two belts of white spots which follows this zone near the
bottom of the first whorl, composed of rather larger spots; with
these exceptions the two shells were precisely the same.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Cedo nulli of Lyonet is described as being of a yellowish
colour, divided into bands, the lower one and that in the middle
marbled with white, the other two marked, the one with four little
belts with white dots, the second with only three<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c006'>I ought not to close these remarks without observing, that these
shells vary so considerably that no two specimens have yet occurred
that agree precisely with each other. Some approach also, but are
clouded instead of banded; these are the French Cedo nulli graphique,
Conus mappa of Solander, and being held in less esteem
from having their colours disposed in clouds instead of bands, have
obtained the name of the false Cedo nulli. The transitions of these
shells, it must be confessed are so various as to render it extremely
difficult, if not unsafe, to determine where one species ends and
another commences, the difference in the colours affords no sufficient
data, neither is the form of the shell, nor the height of the spire so
uniformly certain as to constitute a precise criterion.</p>

<p class='c006'>Linnæus, in his description of the conchological cabinet of her
majesty <i>Ludovica Ulrica</i>, the Queen of Sweden*, speaks of three
different varieties of Conus Ammiralis α <i>Ammiralis summus</i>, β <i>Ammiralis
ordinarius</i>, γ <i>Ammiralis occidentalis</i>, and these are again
recited in his Systema Natura. But it will be seen from the last
edition of that work, by Professor Gmelin, that the varieties discovered
subsequently to the age of that inestimable naturalist are
very considerable, amounting to no less than thirty different kinds,
and these do not include the whole at present known. Gmelin, it
should be added, admits only two or three kinds as the true <span class='sc'>Cedo
nulli</span>, which he characterizes essentially as being encompassed
with dotted articulated belts, Cedo nulli cingulis punctato-articulatis;
one he describes as being yellow, painted with red, and marked with
eleven distinct belts of milk white; another, orange with crouded
elevated interrupted chesnut lines.</p>

<p class='c006'>These shells inhabit chiefly the South American Seas; the
true Cedo nulli, as it is called, has been found at Grenada. Some
of the varieties of Conus Ammiralis, are not very uncommon, and are
in infinitely less esteem than others; for, as it has already appeared,
it is in proportion to their rarity in addition to some peculiarity in
the colours and markings, and most especially in their disposition
into the form of bands, that taste and fancy has affixed a value so
considerable as that which these shells are sometimes known to
bear.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c006'>This curious and very elegant bird is about twelve inches in
length; the bill an inch long and of a pale cinereous or ashen hue,
and, like most other species of this remarkable genus, serrated
along the margin. The legs are feathered to the toes, and with the
toes and claws are of a pale brown.</p>

<p class='c006'>The colour of the head and neck of this species is black, very
richly glossed with blue, which appears, in different directions of
the light, highly splendid upon its surface. Upon the crown of
the head the blue verges into violet and purple, and in descending
towards the neck becomes changeable into a fine green, glossed
with gold; these brilliant hues appear also on the sides of the neck,
and passing round as a kind of pectorial band forms in particular a
rich zone of golden green upon the breast.</p>

<p class='c006'>The pale ashen hue of the bill is singularly contrasted with the
deep black and violet of the head and neck, and the sudden transition
of the colours of the body is no less remarkable, the plumage
in this part becoming abruptly of a fine yellow from the breast
down to the thighs; these latter are black, but the vent feathers
beyond are of a fine yellow, like the colour of the abdomen. The
upper parts of the body are green glossed with yellowish and
partaking of a golden lustre. The upper wing coverts and scapulars
are dark fuscous, mottled with greyish; the quill feathers dark
brown, quills from the base to the middle white. The tail is cuneated
or wedge-formed, the middle feathers being longer than the
outer ones. These feathers are most singularly contrasted with
the rest, being of a fine dark green, glossed with gold, and at the
tip black, while the three outer feathers on the contrary are white,
and from the base downwards nearly to the tip very elegantly marked
with oblique indented bars of black, leaving the tip of each
feather immaculate; the inner one of these three exterior feathers
are the same length as the dark ones, but the next outer feather is
shorter, and the extreme exterior feather on each side shorter than
the latter.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is a variety of this bird in which the belly, instead of
being yellow, is white; the whole bird is a trifle smaller than the
example now before us, and may possibly prove hereafter to be the
same species, in a less mature state of plumage. Buffon calls it
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Le Couroucou verd</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c006'>All the birds of this tribe at present known are inhabitants of
the warmer climates of South America and India. Our present
subject is a native of Cayenne, where it lives in damp and retired
woods, building upon the lower branches of trees and feeding chiefly
upon insects, with which the trees and herbage in those countries
abound.</p>

<p class='c006'>This truly interesting and very beautiful species is already
known in our language by the epithet of the yellow-bellied Trogon
or Curucui. There is, however, another bird of the same genus,
which has the belly yellow, as in the present bird; we allude to the
Rufous Curucui, the better therefore to define our species we have
denominated it the yellow-bellied Green Trogon, or Curucui, as the
least attention to the difference in the general colour of the plumage
will thus enable the most cursory observer to discriminate the two
species with facility and accuracy.</p>

<p class='c006'>The delineations of the very beautiful butterfly that appears in
the annexed plate, are copied from a specimen in the cabinet of the
late worthy president of the Royal Society, Sir Joseph Banks.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fabricius had previously observed and made known throughout
Europe the description of this species with many others of the
Banksian Cabinet, but the figures of it now submitted to the
amateur are the first that have appeared.—When we consider the
celebrity which the entomological writings of Fabricius have acquired
it may be satisfactory to learn that the delineation now before
us is copied from the individual specimen which Fabricius had described,
and that no other figure of this very interesting Papilio is
extant.</p>

<p class='c006'>The upper surface of the butterfly is of a dark brown colour of
peculiar richness, crossed by stripes of deep scarlet. The insect
with expanded wings displayed in a flying position in the lower part
of the plate exemplifies this aspect of the upper surface. The lower
surface is much more beautiful; the marks and colours on the anterior
pair possess nearly the same character as those of the upper
surface; the posterior pair are very different, being marked with
large annular bands of bright yellow upon a fuscous ground, and inclosing
a number of distinct spots of cœrulean blue, which in beauty
emulate the brilliancy of the finest ultra marine: three of these
blue spots are placed in the dark ground upon the disk, the remainder
are disposed in a semi-circle upon a band of black towards the
posterior extremity of the wings. This appearance is best perceived
when the insect appears in a resting position as it is seen
on one of the branches of the mimosa in the upper part of the
plate.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fabricius describes Papilio Pyramus as a new species of the
genus from the drawings of the late Mr. Jones, of Chelsea, a gentleman
of fortune who had long devoted his attention to this peculiar
tribe of insects, the Papiliones, and whose labours tended in a very
eminent degree to aid those of Fabricius. In return for this
assistance, Fabricius affixed to each of those insects the names under
which they were destined afterwards to appear before the world,
a circumstance that may explain sufficiently the frequent references
of the Fabrician writings to those drawings, first in his <cite>Species Insectorum</cite>,
and subsequently in his <cite>Entomologia Systematica</cite>. It
may be further added, that the whole of these drawings, together
with the manuscripts in the hand-writing of Fabricius were long in
our own possession, during the life-time of the very amiable proprietor,
Mr. Jones, for the very liberal purpose of copying and
making known to the public whatever might appear likely to us to
promote the interest and advantage of the Science of Nature; and
that the insect now before us is one of those very rare species copied
for this purpose.</p>

<p class='c006'>The specimen from which the painting of Mr. Jones was taken
formed originally part of the collection of the lamented Mr. Yates,
the ingenious author of an English translation of the Linnæan Fundamenta
Entomologia, that appeared about forty years ago, and
who lost his life by bathing in the river some short time afterwards.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was a variety of this insect, pretty nearly but not exactly
according with this in the collection of an old and well-known entomologist,
the late Mr. Drury, a figure of which appeared shortly
after the publication of the Fabrician writings as the true Papilio
Pyramus. It was not precisely the same as it appeared to us from
an inspection of the specimen in the cabinet of Mr. Drury. This
insect is to be found represented in the 23rd plate of the third
volume of the Exotic Insects of that author, published in the year
1782.</p>

<p class='c006'>The fine example from which our figure of this rare and interesting
Volute is taken, once held a distinguished place in the
Conchological department of the celebrated museum of Sir Ashton
Lever. The length of this shell is four inches and one eighth, its
greatest breadth two inches and three eighths; the colour a kind
of buff with an olivaceous tint, and the whole surface traversed
with a number of irregularly undulated or zig-zag lines of dark
brown, disposed longitudinally throughout: the peculiar character
of which will be conceived more readily from the delineation
than from any explanation that can be conveyed by words. These
longitudinal lines are numerous upon the back or superior surface
of the first wreath of the shell, and extends also on the lower surface
as far as the dilated space of the columella or pillar lip; which
latter is of a pure white and destitute of any markings. The mouth
or aperture with the interior of the shell is also white, and the
plaits of the pillar, which constitutes one of the most essential
characters of the genus Volute, are prominent and well defined.</p>

<p class='c006'>This species of Voluta has long retained its reputation as a
shell of distinguished rarity; it was very rare in the time of Kircher
and Bonanni, and it has continued scarce even to the present
period. At the sale of the Leverian collection, the example of
which the delineation is now before us, produced the sum of five
guineas and a half: since that time other specimens of the same
species have occurred occasionally to observation, but which have
still maintained an equal price in proportion to their excellence or
perfection. The Leverian shell was a most select example, and
has not been surpassed in point of beauty by any of the specimens
we have since seen. At the dissolution of that inestimable museum,
which happened in the year 1806, this admirable shell passed into
the possession of the worthy secretary of the Linnæan Society,
A. Mc. Leay, Esq. and it still constitutes a part of the fine Conchological
collection of that very eminent naturalist.</p>

<p class='c006'>The late Dr. Solander, as it appears from his manuscripts preserved
in the library of the late worthy President of the Royal
Society, Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. had designated this kind of Voluta
by the name of Nobilis; it is a fine shell and not unworthy of that
distinguished appellation. It is however certain, that it is no other
than a variety of Voluta Scapha of the Linnæan school<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a>, and as the
changing and transposition of names that are sufficiently explicit
and well understood can only tend to create confusion instead of
aiding the pursuits of science, we can have no hesitation in retaining
it under its former designation. As a variety, we admit this
shell to be distinct and well defined, and to be so far prominent as
to merit a definitive appellation; and it is under this persuasion the
term Nobilis, assigned but by Dr. Solander, is subjoined to the
specific name Voluta Scapha.</p>

<p class='c006'>This very rare kind of Voluta Scapha is from China, the
variety more coarse in its general appearance that constitutes the
type of this species, is a native of the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p class='c006'>Among the older definitions by which this shell was known
among the early writers, we may mention that of the learned Kircher,
whose museum of curiosities, extant in the beginning of the
last century, contained a shell of this kind, which Bonanni thus
describes:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Conchylium ea parte latius qua in turbinem desinit
sine aculeis, et tuberculis, foramen non rotundum, ut in Purpura
et Buccina, sed longum.</i></span>” Musaei Kircheriani. classis iii. 10. 450.
et Bonan. 113.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may not be amiss to observe, in conclusion, that amidst all
the improvements which modern naturalists have made in the science
of Conchology, Voluta Scapha still remains a Volute among the
most approved writers of the present day, while most of those species
considered by Linnæus as appertaining to the same genus are
removed to other newly-constituted genera.</p>

<p class='c006'>The character of the true Volute, as it is at present laid down,
consists in the shell being of an oval form, more or less ventricose,
or swollen, the summit obtuse and ending in a kind of papilla, or
teat, the base of the shell cut off or somewhat truncated: without
canal, and the pillar charged with plaits or folds, of which the inferior
ones are the largest and longest. The precise contrary of this
is observable in the new genus <span class='sc'>Mitra</span>, of which <i>Voluta Episcopalis</i>
is considered as the type. In this last mentioned shell, the body
instead of being ventricose is subfusiform, the spire pointed at the
summit, and the lower plaits upon the pillar smaller instead of
larger. The contrast between these two tribes will, it is conceived,
sufficiently illustrate the characteristic peculiarities of the genus
Volute, as it is at present constituted.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c006'>There is not, throughout the very ample range of the creation
which the feathered tribes present to our consideration, a race of
beings more deservedly admired for their beauty than the Humming-Birds.
Natives of the warmer climates of the globe: of countries
where the fervour of a tropic sun calls forth the spontaneous productions
of the earth bedecked in gaiety unexampled in other regions
of the earth, these little beings seem to participate in all its
genial influence. With forms the most pleasing for symmetry and
elegance they combine a brilliancy of colours the most splendid;
their golden hues, their sapphirine tints, the lustre of the emerald,
the ruby, garnet, amethyst, and topaz, with which their plumage is
adorned, is not surpassed in brightness by the valued gems whose
hues they borrow, and whose splendours emulate; as though, in this
much-favoured race we beheld the richest gems of earth inspired
with life, and endowed with powers of activity and will. The
flowers whose nectareous juices afford them sustenance, are moreover
the liveliest and most luxuriant among those that adorn the
surface of the teeming earth:—in a word, the Humming-Birds,
poised and fluttering upon the wing, or flitting from flower to flower,
in search of food beneath the fervid illumination of a cloudless tropic
sun, present a spectacle of the works of nature upon a scale of
miniature the most pleasing and most brilliant.</p>

<p class='c006'>Owing to the slender structure of the bill, the Humming-Birds
have some difficulty in obtaining their support; the luxuriant fruits
of the tropic world afford them no repast: their bills are much too
feeble to penetrate their rind to derive subsistence from their fluids.
It is the rich juices of the flowers and not the fruits that afford them
food; the fluids which they find secreted in the nectaria of flowers,
the nectaria of those plants in particular which have the flowers long
and tubular, and in which those repositories of mellifluous fluid lie
in the bottom of the corolla are the favourite objects of their resort.
About the flowers of this kind the Humming-Birds are seen hovering
like bees, and like those industrious creatures extracting at the
same time those juices of the flowers by means of their elongated
tongue. The construction of the tongue in this tribe of birds is
singular and deserving of explicit mention; it consists of two tubular
filiform threads, which coalesce throughout their whole length, excepting
at the tips, where they are divided, or bifid; this organ,
which is remarkable for its extreme length, it inserts deeply down
into the corolla of the flowers, and is thus enabled to obtain the
nectar nearly in the same manner as the insects of the sphinx genus.
The Humming-Birds, when on the wing, are observed to emit a
humming noise, like that of the bee, and it is apparently from this
circumstance that this class of the feathered race have derived the
appellation of Humming-Birds.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the different species of the Humming-Bird, though uniformly
small, vary much in magnitude, from the bigness indeed of
the wren and others of our smaller warblers to a size more diminutive
than several of the larger kinds of the bee tribe, the nests of
these birds, as may be conceived, are found to vary materially according
to the size of the species to which they appertain. These
little local habitations of the infant brood are all comparatively
small, are usually of a roundish form, lined with the softest downy
leaves, and each in general contains two little eggs, scarcely exceeding
the size of peas, and of a pure white colour without any
spots.</p>

<p class='c006'>The slenderness of the bill and weakness of the legs in this
tribe of birds sufficiently demonstrate that they are inadequate to
any contests with other kinds of the feathered race; they are nevertheless
observed among themselves to be rather of a pugnaceous
disposition. Their usual contests are for their mates or for the
possession of some favourite flower, and are observed to take place
while on the wing. Their mode of attack is by striking with
violence against each other, for they never attempt to assault each
other with their bill and their feet are much too small and feeble
for conflict.</p>

<p class='c006'>The species of Humming-Bird now before us is one of the
larger kinds, its length being about six inches from the tip of the
bill to the extremity of the tail, exclusive of the two elongated
feathers which extend beyond the true tail about two inches; the
bill is long, slender, and slightly incurvated, and of a whitish colour
with the tip black. The most characteristic peculiarity is the large
space of topazine or golden green immediately beneath the chin,
and which expands over the whole surface of the throat. The head
is blackish purple, and the same colour descending along the sides
of the neck passes in a kind of crescent round the breast, thus constituting
an abrupt separation between the vivid green space of the
chin and throat, and the vivid lustre of the abdomen, which is a fine
crimson or ruby colour from the breast nearly to the vent, where it
becomes interspersed with a few white feathers; the feathers of the
thigh are white also. The back and wing coverts are brown with
tints and shades of greenish, and glosses of a golden yellow. The
greater quill feathers are fuscous, the tail coverts are fine green;
the tail orange, except the two remarkable elongated candal
feathers, which are black. The legs pale.</p>

<p class='c006'>Notwithstanding the very decisive character which this species
of Humming-Bird displays, and which considered individually can
leave us little reason to distrust its identity as a species, we are not
to overlook the very near approximation of this kind with some
others that are described as specifically different, such as the Sapphire
Humming-Bird, and that distinguished by the appellation of the
Sapphire and Emerald Humming-Bird. The near approach of
these and some others to the species now before us appears to be
sufficiently obvious to induce a persuasion that in a less mature state
one kind may sometimes have been mistaken for another, and this
becomes the more probable when we recollect that the Humming-Birds
in general, like many of the larger tribes of the feathered race,
do not arrive at their full perfection of plumage till the second and
more commonly till the third year.</p>

<p class='c006'>Papilio Marcellina is a butterfly of peculiar simplicity and
beauty in its general effect. The upper surface is of a fine yellow
with a singular subocellate spot or stigma of a reddish brown in the
centre of the anterior wings, and a series of double spots of the same
colour, disposed towards the exterior margin both of the anterior
and the posterior pair. The lower surface, as we perceive from the
Butterfly at rest, with the wings erect in the upper part of the
plate, is rather more of an orange or fulvous hue, and instead of
having the disk immaculate like the upper surface, except the stigma
in the anterior wings, are sprinkled with reddish brown. The centre
of the wings, as well the posterior as the anterior pair, are
marked with two silver spots, and which, from their near approximation,
may be denominated, according to the language of Fabricius,
a geminous or double spot of silver.</p>

<p class='c006'>This elegant insect is figured from a specimen in the collection
of the celebrated Dr. Hunter, the individual example described and
referred to by Fabricius in his <cite>Species Insectorum</cite> and <cite>Entomologia
Systematica</cite> as expressed among the synonyms above recited.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Papilio Marcellina has appeared already in the costly work
of Cramer, upon the Papiliones tribe, we are nevertheless induced
to present a figure of the species to our readers, in order to point
out the very close affinity that prevails between this insect and
another much more frequent species named Papilio Sennæ. This
latter mentioned Butterfly is figured by Sloane, Merian, and Seba;
Papilio Marcellina by Cramer only. These insects resemble each
other, but are nevertheless distinct; the specific character of Papilio
Sennæ consists chiefly, according to Linnæus, in having the double
spot in the centre of each wing of a ferruginous colour, while in
Papilio Marcellina that characteristic mark has the exact appearance
of two approximating spots of molten silver. The tips of the wings
in Papilio Sennæ are sometimes spotted as in Marcellina and are
sometimes destitute of spots.</p>

<p class='c006'>Both these analogous species are natives of Surinam; Sloane
describes Papilio Sennæ, in his Natural History of Jamaica, as an
inhabitant of that island.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c006'>This very scarce and pretty species of the Papilio tribe is an
inhabitant of Cayenne, and may possibly occur also in other parts of
South America. It was unknown to Fabricius when he published
the work entitled <cite>Species Insectorum</cite>; he afterwards observed a
species of it in the cabinet of Von Rohr, and inserted a description
of it between the two species P. Hecabe and P. Cardamines in his
subsequent production <cite>Entomologia Systematica</cite>.</p>

<p class='c006'>The upper surface of this Butterfly is entirely yellow, without
any marks, excepting only the apex of the anterior wings, which
are black in that portion of the tip which appears red on the lower

<p class='c006'>The varieties of the very beautiful species now before us are
rather numerous, as may be imagined from its moulting twice in a
year, and not arriving, as it is pretty generally believed, at its full state
of plumage till nearly the third year. These are the progressive
changes of the male bird, and it may be also added, that the female
undergoes several mutations of the same kind, as well as the male
bird.</p>

<p class='c006'>When its plumage has attained its full perfection, there are
few birds of more striking beauty than the male of this species. Its
size is scarcely inferior to that of our common Hedge Sparrow, the
length between five and six inches. The head and neck of a fine
blue purple, with a circle of red round the eyes. The whole of the
underside, including the chin, throat, breast, and abdomen, is a
fulvous, or rather a vivid scarlet; the back green, below which is a
space of yellow, and the rump scarlet, like the abdomen. The wings
are greenish, being shaded with brown, and having the edges of the
feathers of a delicate green: the greater wing coverts in our specimen
are of a pale rose colour, and which in the general conformation of
the plumage constitutes a roseate band across the wings. The tail,
like the wings, are brownish, having the edges of each feather green;
the bill and legs dark.</p>

<p class='c006'>In some of the varieties of this bird, occasioned as before observed,
through the moulting of the feathers, the blue purple of
the head and neck is more generally extended along the back, and
sometimes appears in patches upon other parts of the plumage.
Sometimes, also, the dark spots that appear upon the scarlet space of
the chin, throat, breast, and abdomen, are more diffused, and in
other states of moulting the abdomen becomes yellow or yellowish.
The abdomen has also, in some instances, been known to change
white, leaving only a rounded spot of red upon the breast.</p>

<p class='c006'>Catesby describes this species as a native of Carolina. It is an
inhabitant of all the warmer parts of America, extending from Mexico
and Peru, as far as Canada, in the milder seasons of the year. It
is rather a hardy bird, insomuch, that some attempts have been made
by the Dutch to naturalize the species in Europe, like the Canary;
but not, however, with the same success, although they may be kept
alive for some time after being brought into the less genial climates
of the Continent of Europe.</p>

<p class='c006'>The celebrated Marmaduke Tunstall, Esq. a most indefatigable
Naturalist, who lived towards the latter part of the preceding
century, has stated, that two pair of these birds made their nests and
laid eggs in the orange trees of a Menagery at Holderness, in Yorkshire,
but observes at the same time, the eggs were unproductive.
Mr. Tunstall, as a Collector, was the great rival of Sir Ashton Lever,
and of authority unquestionable, and this circumstance tends to
shew that it might be yet possible to rear these very beautiful birds
in this country. Some authors have presumed upon the authority
of Albin, that this species extends to China. There can be very little
doubt that the figure in the third volume of Albin’s plate, denominated
the China Bulfinch, is intended for this bird. Albin assures
us that he saw the bird he figured in the possession of a curious
gentlemen, who told him he had received it from China.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the warmer parts of America, which these birds, as before
observed, inhabit, they occur sometimes in vast flocks; it does not
appear that they are of a shy or timid disposition, yet it is said they
are seldom seen near habitable places, and never in any considerable
numbers together.</p>

<p class='c006'>This superb shell, admitted to be the finest example of its
kind, at present known, once constituted part of the Conchological
Collection of Sir Ashton Lever; and continued to be a distinguished
ornament of that Museum after it passed into the hands of Mr. Parkinson.
At the dissolution of that Museum, which took place in the
month of May, June, and the beginning of July, in the year 1806,
the specimen became the property of a very celebrated amateur, the
late Mr. Jennings: he purchased it at the sale for the sum of seven
pounds.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c015'><sup>[6]</sup></a> Mr. Jennings is since dead, and his collection being, like
the former, dispersed by public sale: we are no longer certain in
whose possession this very beautiful rarity now remains.</p>

<p class='c006'>Besides that this shell excels in magnitude every other known
example of its kind, the formation of the shell itself is extremely fine,
its perfection exquisite, the colouring of the richest and most decided
hues, and the marks and lines throughout, which so eminently
characterize the shell, definitely distinct; we shall dwell no further
on the peculiar beauty of this shell, from a persuasion that the
drawing will be found so explicit and so satisfactory, as to render a
minute description needless: it was taken with peculiar care, by
permission of its proprietor, while it remained in the Leverian
Museum, and will not, we are convinced, be found defective in point
of accuracy, upon the most attentive comparison with the original,
should that ever be produced in competition with it.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the Linnæan arrangement of Conchology, the shells of this
kind constitute a species of the Genus Buccinum, the Buccinum
Harpa of that author. Previous to the time of Linnæus, the best
Conchologists had considered those particular shells that possess the
essential characters of the Common Harp Shell, as a distinct genus.
Rumpfius so adopts it under the name of Harpa; and Argenville
subsequently regarding that particular kind called Buccinum Harpa,
by Linnæus, as the type of the genus, denominates it, by way of
eminence, Harpa Nobilis. By some inconceivable error it has been
asserted that Lamarck was the first author who separated the family
of Harps from the genus Buccinum; this is evidently a mistake, as we
perceive from Rumpfius and Argenville, and as we are now proceeding
to shew from the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Catalogue Systématique et Raisonné</cite></span>,” of the
once celebrated cabinet of M. de Davilla; besides which, some others
might be added, were it material to notice them.</p>

<p class='c006'>As we have introduced the subject of Davilla’s Cabinet, it will,
perhaps, afford some pleasure to many of our readers if we mention a
few of those very beautiful varieties of this natural family of the
Harps, which were once concentrated in that costly collection.
These, collectively, appear to have presented a series of the most
choice and interesting of the varieties at that time known. The
distinctions are taken from the number of the prominent ridges with
which these shells are longitudinally traversed, and these, it hence
appears, varied from thirteen to fourteen and fifteen in number.
One of these, a very fine shell, and deemed the type of the <i>Harpe</i>
tribe, was the Harpa Nobilis of D’Argenville: it had fifteen ribs, was
very regularly marked with alternate zic-zac lines of brown and
white, or rather of brown lines disposed upon a white ground, with
a small intermediate incurvate line of grey traversing the middle of
each of the white lines, in the same, direction as those of brown; a
disposition of marking, very similar to the zic-zac lineations upon the
shell represented in the annexed plate. There were two other Harps,
in which the number of ribs, or ridges, amounted to no more than
fourteen, so that the sides were larger; and they were also more
inclined than in the preceding. These were marbled, and marked
with streaks and dashes of rose colour, yellow, white, and chesnut, a
large intermediate and rather deeper coloured zone, or band, passed
round the middle of the shell, and two large spots of brown appeared
on the under surface of the shell. There were yet two other Harps,
which differed in their colours and markings from the preceding;
one of these had only twelve ribs, or ridges, the other thirteen.
The colours in one of these were paler, in the other the zic-zac lines,
were more contiguous, or placed closer, and the longitudinal striæ
less distinct or prominent. And besides these, there were several
others, all which differed in some peculiarities of inferior moment,
principally in the paleness or intensity of their colours, and variations
in the disposition of the dark and paler spaces with which the
shells were marbled.</p>

<p class='c006'>The above series of Davila presents us with a pretty ample
elucidation of the presumed varieties of that beautiful species the
Linnæan Buccinum Harpa. We say, only the presumed varieties,
because in the present state of the Conchological Science there
appears to be a very strong propensity among collectors to increase
the number of the species, by considering every trivial variation, or
accidental circumstance in the growth of shells, as so many characteristic
indications of new species; a disposition that the best Conchologists
cannot but disapprove. Experience teaches us that there is no
class of beings in the creation, in which nature is more sportive, than
the testaceous tribes; none in which a greater caution is required in
the precise determination of what are species and what varieties only:
and among other local causes the influence of climates in different
regions are not the least powerful in producing those variations.
With the best experience, and the advantage of many years assiduous
application, the Conchologist may be sometimes in doubt, and hence
it is not likely that a slight acquaintance, only, with the subject will
be found sufficient to enable him to pronounce with definitive satisfaction
the exact distinction between approximating species and the
sportive varieties into which they sometimes divaricate. These
remarks cannot be more forcibly exemplified than in the series of the
presumed varieties of the Buccinum Harpa. Some of these are
indeed so very dissimilar as to justify a persuasion that they may be
specifically distinct, and yet again, these are blended so intimately
with others, which are confessedly varieties, that it demands the
utmost caution in pronouncing which are species, and which varieties
or transitions only. This is the impression under which the best
informed Conchologists have ever ventured to define the shells which
constitute the natural family of the Harps, and may serve to afford
us a sufficient explanation of the causes of those differences in opinion
which so manifestly prevail among them.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may not be very generally known, excepting only among
Naturalists, that the late Dr. Solander had devoted much attention
to this intricate science: his arrangement of shells was designed as an
amendment upon that of Linnæus. This arrangement was never
made public; it remained in manuscript in the library of the late
Sir Joseph Banks. From a perusal of these MSS. it appears that
Dr. Solander had conceived the necessity of a new disposition of the
shells comprised in general as varieties of this species. Some he
allows to remain varieties, while others constitute, in his ideas,
species nearly analogous, but nevertheless distinct. He does not propose
the formation of an independant genus of the Harp family, nor
the removal of those shells from the genus Buccinum, in which Linnæus
places the species Harpa: he proposes only to assemble together
the least equivocal varieties of that shell, together with that which he
considers as the type of the Linnæan species, the true Harpa Nobilis
of preceding authors; and to allow the others to remain as species
distinct from the Linnæan shell. It will be hence perceived that
Dr. Solander’s constitutes several distinct species among the number
of those Harps, which other writers, and Gmelin among the rest,
regard as varieties only of the common kind. In the manuscripts of
Dr. Solander the very beautiful Harp shell now before us stands as
a distinct species from Buccinum Harpa, under the name of <i>Buccinum
testudo</i>. Some of the French Naturalists have called it <i>Harpa
testudinaria</i>: it was placed under that name, and its synonymous
appellation <i>L’ecaille de Tortue</i> in the once celebrated Museum of
Mons. de Colonne, the French Minister of State, under Louis the
XVI: the definitive English name of Tortoiseshell Harp was
assigned to it by Mr. George Humphrey, and from his known
authority in the study of shells, this variety has been since distinguished
among collectors in our country by that appropriate appellation.
All these names, it will be scarcely necessary to add, are
devised in allusion to that resemblance which its peculiarly beautiful
variegations of colour are conceived to bear, to those of tortoiseshell,
when transparent and exposed to light.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have been at some pains in our endeavours to reconcile our
mind to the idea of introducing this Tortoiseshell Harp as a species
distinct from the Buccinum Harpa, in conformity with the opinion of
Dr. Solander. We have compared our shell with the acknowledged
type of the Linnæan species, with every attention, and are compelled,
in truth, to allow, that however distinct it may appear upon the first
glance of inspection, we cannot implicitly accede to the persuasion of
its being specifically distinct. Placing this remarkable variety with
that particular shell, the true Buccinum Harpa, the less informed
Conchologist would assume as certain that the difference existing
between the two removed them sufficiently from each other. Arrange
these, however, with those varieties and transitions of the Common
Harp that approach the nearest in appearance to both kinds, and we
shall then perceive such a close analogy, such an intermediate catenation,
as will induce a pause, and certainly under the impression with
which we view them, an idea that these variations arise only from
local causes, and are not specifical distinctions. As a marked and
well distinguished variety we have retained the term <i>testudo</i>, which
Dr. Solander had assigned to it; but as a distinctive appellation of
it as a variety, and not as a shell altogether distinct.</p>

<p class='c006'>That it may not be imagined we feel any disposition to object
against those changes in the Science of Conchology, which the more
advanced state of our present knowledge may demand, we have no
hesitation in adding that in our own opinion the <i>Harpa</i> family should
constitute a very distinct tribe from the other Buccini; we believe,
also, that had Linnæus lived to reconsider them, he would have
comprehended them together as a genus. The French writers have
long since done so. De Monfort advances that Lamarck was the first
who separated the Harps from the Linnæan Buccinum. This we
have already shewn to be an error. Lamarck’s example in proposing
them as a genus in his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Système des Animaux sans Vertèbres</cite></span>, published
in the year 1801, and his subsequent observations in other
writings, has tended to establish them as a genus; he was not its
first proposer.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may not be amiss, in conclusion, to observe, that Lamarck has
taken for the type of his genus, the variety figured by Lister, in his
Conchology, <i>tab.</i> 992 f. 55, the shell which he denominates Harpa
Ventricosa. The leading character of his genus consists in the shell
being of an oval form, ventricose or swollen, and having the surface
furnished or beset with longitudinal, parallel, and sharp or acutely
edged ribs. The opening or mouth, oblong, ample, abbreviated or
cut off below, and without canal. The pillar, or inner lip, smooth,
or without plaits or tubercles, and terminating in a point at the base.
The absence of a canal is one material character by which the Harpa
genus, as thus laid down, is to be distinguished from the new genus
Trophon, to which, in some respects, at least, it bears a general
resemblance. The definition of the genus by De Montfort is rather
different from that of Lamarck: according to De Montfort the shells
of this family are globose; the first whorl very far surpassing the
rest in size, and the spire obtuse. The mouth is very open. The
pillar or inner lip smooth and rounded. The outer lip bordered by
an acutely edged rib or ridge, running paralled to those with which
the shell is traversed externally, and the base cut off. The spire in
the true Harpa, according to this writer, forms a kind of little domes,
one surmounting the other, and the spire, instead of ending in an
acute point, terminates in a small mammillated knob.</p>

<p class='c006'>All the known varieties of this natural family are inhabitants of
the deep waters of the sea, and the animal inhabitants appear to have
remained hitherto undescribed. They are confined chiefly to the
Indian Seas. The variety known by the name of Nobilis is a native
of Japan; there is another found in China, distinguished by the
name of Chinensis: both these are considered by Dr. Solander as the
Buccinum Harpa of Linnæus: there is one kind found at Ceylon,
and another at Madagascar, which are to be esteemed distinct species.
The sanguineous Harp, from the Coast of Guinea, is the Buccinum
pandura of Solander. The Harp, distinguished by having a far
greater number of elevated ribs than any of the preceding, is from the
seas of the Phillippine Isles, and is certainly a distinct species. The
very fine variety which constitutes the more immediate object of our
present illustration, the Tortoiseshell Harp, is a native of Madagascar:
its length is four inches, and its greatest breadth two inches
and a half.</p>

<p class='c006'>A pretty species of the Fringilla tribe, about the size of our
smaller Linnets. The bill and legs of this bird are of a pale flesh
colour: the body above, together with the wings, of a greyish brown:
the lower part of the back, rump, and whole of the underside, of a
delicate azure blue; the tail blue, of a somewhat deeper tint, and
rather cuneated or wedge-formed. This is the general appearance
of the plumage in both sexes, excepting, only, that the colours are
usually somewhat brighter in the male than the female bird; and that
the male bird is distinguished further by having a dark red spot on
each side of the head, beneath the eyes, a character altogether wanting
in the female.</p>

<p class='c006'>It should be observed that these birds vary occasionally in the
colours of their plumage, particularly in the cærulean tints of the
under surface, which sometimes inclines to a pale rufous grey, or to
blue intermixed with rufous grey; and in some instances when the
state of plumage is less mature, the latter colour predominates so
entirely on the lower surface, that only a transition tint of the azure
appears upon the breast and abdomen.</p>

<p class='c006'>Linnæus was induced to imagine that the two sexes of this bird
were distinct species, the male he denominated <i>Fringilla Bengalus</i>,
the female <i>Fringilla Angolensis</i>; the male bird, which he happened
to describe, having been received from Bengal, the female from
Angola. The truth is, that this widely diffused species inhabits both
these places in common, with many others in Asia and Africa: in
Angola, in particular, they appear to be very common.</p>

<p class='c006'>We cannot for a moment hesitate to believe that in announcing
to our readers the introduction of the Pink, or Roseate Imperial Sun
Trochus: the significant appellation under which the present rarity
has been for many years distinguished, we shall awaken the attention
of every Conchologist and amateur of the science. The shell so
named, formerly constituted an object, no less conspicuous than
beautiful, among the Conchological productions treasured together
in the once celebrated Leverian Museum. And, as we possessed,
through the immediate favour of the proprietor of that Museum,
John Parkinson, Esq. an unreserved access to every article in the
Museum, for the purpose of delineating the figures, or taking the
descriptions of whatever we conceived worthy of such observation, it
will be naturally imagined the Pink, or Roseate Imperial Sun Trochus,
would be esteemed of too much importance to escape our very
particular attention. The dispersion of that once celebrated Repository
of Natural History has long since removed, and probably for
ever, this exquisite rarity from the eye of public curiosity; nor
indeed is its present destination correctly known; a circumstance, it
is presumed, that cannot fail to enhance the value of a drawing,
which we have every reason for believing to be the only memorial of
this kind the pencil of the Arts have consecrated to the commemoration
of the shell: the only figure, we are assured, the proprietor ever
permitted to be taken from it.—Having premised so far, it will not
be deemed superfluous to add, that the outline of the specimen is
precisely a fac-simile of the shell itself, having been traced round its
contour while lying upon the paper, and being afterwards finished in
colours upon the outlines so struck, with every attention an object so
estimable was presumed to merit.</p>

<p class='c006'>The history of this curious variety of the Imperial Sun Trochus
is altogether interesting, and deserves explicit mention; it is one
among the number of those rare shells which were discovered by that
distinguished navigator, Captain Cook, in his voyage round the
world. It was fished up in the Straits that divide the Island of New
Zealand, now distinguished after him, by the appellation of Cook’s
Straits. Upon the return of Captain Cook to England, he presented
Sir Ashton Lever, among other articles of great curiosity, with this
particular shell, the only one of its kind he had found. The Imperial
Sun Trochus, of an olivaceous violet hue, the shell which constitutes
the type of this species, though very scarce, occurred occasionally,
but this Pink variety only in the solitary instance before
adverted to: it was drawn up, adhering to the cable of the ship,
from the depth, as it appeared, of sixty fathoms water.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c015'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>In the general computation of the value of the various articles
in the Museum of the late Sir Ashton Lever, submitted to government,
previous to the grant of the Lottery which transferred the
possession of that Museum from its original founder to the hands of
Mr. Parkinson, this shell was estimated at the value of <i>one hundred
guineas</i>: and as this valuation was arbitrary, that sum was considered
as the worth of the shell while it remained in the Museum. At the
final dissolution of this Museum, which took place in the months of
May, June, and July of the year 1806, this shell, like the rest, was
submitted to the chance of taste or caprice: it was sold on the last
day of the sale, for the sum of twenty three guineas, an amount considerably
below its former valuation, but sufficient, nevertheless, to
shew that its attractions were still great in the mind of the connoisseur.</p>

<p class='c006'>The purchaser of this shell was at that time unknown, subsequently,
however, the specimen appeared among the property sold at
the residence of the Duke de Bourbon, immediately after the departure
of that noblemen for France, in the beginning of the year 1815.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a>
Dr. Leach has since that time informed us that he had given instructions
for the purchase of this shell for the British Museum: the
shell does not, however, appear in that collection, and the lamented
illness of our ingenious friend, is likely, for the present, to preclude
all further inquiry respecting its final destination.</p>

<p class='c006'>It does not appear that this very curious variety of the Imperial
Sun Trochus is known in any of the continental cabinets: the
olivaceous kind, which as before observed, is to be regarded as the
type of the species, though esteemed scarce, is to be found in every
continental cabinet of importance. Indeed, the olive kind maintained
a very high reputation and price for many years after the time of
Captain Cook, who brought several of them to England; from whence
those continental cabinets were, in the first instances, supplied. Since
that time the same seas have been attentively explored by Admiral
Bligh, in the ships of his Majesty under his command; and
through his researches, this shell, which was once considered of such
unusual rarity, has become rather more common. The Pink, or
Roseate variety, the immediate object of our present illustration, has
hitherto, however, escaped all research, and it still remains as it was
esteemed originally, after a lapse of nearly fifty years, not merely
scarce, but perfectly unique.</p>

<p class='c006'>An ingenious French writer of the present day, Denys de
Montfort, in describing the olivaceous kind, the type, as before
remarked, of the present species, has paid an appropriate tribute of
applause to the memory of its original discoverers. “It is,” says he,
“to the Voyages of the celebrated Captain Cook, and to the researches
of the indefatigable Naturalists who accompanied him, that we owe
the knowledge of this fine and magnificent shell.” “This shell,” he
adds, “appears to be exposed to such a swarm of aggressors, that
his Mollusca (or animal) must lead a life of activity and war: his
shelly covering is ploughed, or furrowed, and pierced by a host of
enemies, and he must necessarily employ almost the whole of life in
repressing their attacks, and in constantly repairing the breaches and
perforations they occasion, by the exudation of the nacrous molecules,
or fluid, with which nature has furnished him, in order to preserve
the inner coating of his shelly habitation entire.” Such is really the
appearance of this shell in general; we have seen it so completely
despoiled of its exterior coating by these attacks, as to render it
impossible to form any tolerable conception of the shell when perfect;
even an approach towards perfection in its outer coating is very rare.
The most complete of its kind in the collection of the late Admiral
Bligh, and probably selected as the best he ever met with, was
perfect in this respect than might be expected. By one of those rare
chances which sometimes happen, the Roseate variety, which forms
the subject of our present illustration, had entirely escaped every
accident of this nature, insomuch, that its figure may be regarded as
that of a very perfect shell.</p>

<p class='c006'>The earliest figures of the common, or olivaceous kind, occurs
in the work of Chemnitz, and among the plates of Martin. Gmelin
quotes the former, and describes the shell under the name of Trochus
Imperialis. It is truly a Trochus of the Linnæan classification, but
not, it appears, of any later writer, excepting those of the Linnæan
school. Sometimes it has been generically classed as a species of
<span class='sc'>Solarium</span>, a name assigned by Lamarck to the Trochi possessing
the character of the Linnæan <i>Trochus Perspectivus</i>, and which he
renders into his own language as a generical epithet, by the name
<i>Cadran</i> (Sun dial). To accord exactly with the genus Solarium, as
laid down by Lamarck himself, the general figure of the shell should
be that of a depressed cone, having at the base an umblical opening,
crenulated upon the inner edge of all the spires; as may be perceived
in looking down the umbilical opening of Trochus perspectivus; and
finally, the opening of the mouth should be almost quadrangular.
This is the character of <span class='sc'>Solarium</span>, as proposed by Lamarck, and
which does not agree exactly with the shell before us.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c015'><sup>[9]</sup></a> Denys de
Montfort constitutes another genus of this shell, which he denominates
<span class='sc'>Imperator</span> (<cite>Conchyliologie Systematique T. 2. p. 199</cite>) in
the French, <span class='sc'>L’Empereur</span>. The olivaceous kind he calls Imperator
aureolatus, l’Empereur couronné. The character of this new genus,
Imperator, consists in the shell having a regular spire: in being
imbricated, or covered with scales, like tiling upon the roof of a
house: the carina of the whorls armed; the armament, for example,
in the shell before us, consisting of a kind of frieze or curled foliage-like
plates which succeed each other with great regularity: it has an
umbilicus, which, in the present shell is large and deep; the mouth
of the shell angular and entire; pillar lip spreading somewhat like
a fan; and the exterior lip cut off. We have deemed it requisite to
advert to these new genera, but as the shell itself is so clearly a
Trochus, we have not thought it necessary to remove it from the
place in the Linnæan System to which Gmelin had assigned.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have much pleasure in assuring our readers that the present
figures of this very elegant and rare Papilio, are the first that have
appeared in illustration of the species. This becomes the more
incumbent to observe, because those figures afford an elucidation of
some moment at least, to the writings of an Entomologist of acknowledged
eminence, the late Professor Fabricius: he had described the
species in his several works as above adverted to, under the name of
Papilio Egæa, but these descriptions have remained before the
learned world for nearly half a century without any pictorial illustration.
The existence of such a species is therefore well known, but
from description only, and this circumstance, it is presumed, will
tend to confer more real interest upon the figures now produced, than
if it had been entirely undescribed, because, heretofore, a deficiency
has been in this respect perceived; and that deficiency is now supplied
by the figures submitted to our readers in the annexed plate.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first description of this species, as already intimated, to be
found among authors, is that given by Fabricius in his <cite>Systematica
Entomologia</cite>: subsequently it appeared in his work entitled <cite>Species
Insectorum</cite>, and lastly in his <cite>Entomologia Systematica</cite>, as inserted
among our synonyms. It is these authorities that have supplied
Gmelin with the description of the species as we find introduced by
him, into the last edition of the Linnæan Systema Naturæ.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Fabrician description of this insect was taken in the first
instance, <cite>Syst. Ent.</cite> from a specimen in the Hunterian collection:
the same description occurs again in <cite>Spec. Ins.</cite> and lastly, in far
more copious detail in <cite>Ent. Syst.</cite> This latter description given by
Fabricius, though by some oversight of its author, not identified by
any reference with the drawings of Mr. Jones, was certainly derived
from that source of authority; a point we have been enabled to
ascertain, both upon the kind information of our late worthy friend
Mr. Jones himself, and also from the manuscripts in the hand-writing
of Fabricius, which Mr. Jones was pleased to place in our hands, in
order to assure us, there could be no uncertainty in this respect from
any lapse of memory. Fabricius refers for his Papilio Egæa to the
Hunterian cabinet. There was a specimen of this insect in that
collection, but it may not be improper to observe that the specimen
from which the drawing of this species, Papilio Egæa, by Mr. Jones,
was taken, as it appeared from these MSS. was one preserved in the
cabinet of Mr. Drury, the venerable author of a well known work on
Exotic insects, published towards the close of the last century. We
may also add, that this insect, with many others which Mr. Jones
had figured, and Fabricius had described, from that extensive and
valuable cabinet, devolved into our hands after the death of its
proprietor, the whole collection having been dispersed by public sale
in the month of May, 1805.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have been thus minute in the production of authorities, in
order to demonstrate that we have not ventured upon the hazard of
conjecture to submit the present figures as those of the true Papilio
Egæa of Fabricius; and, consequently, of all later writers who have
relied upon his evidence. In stating this, it may not be amiss to add
still further for the information, as well as the gratification of the
Naturalist, not of this country alone, but of Europe generally; and
indeed of every portion of the world to which the light of science may
extend, that we are in possession of the like authorities for the whole
series of those Papiliones which Fabricius has described from the
drawings of Mr. Jones, and which, in most instances, are the only
unequivocal authorities now remaining. Possessing this means, it
shall become the great object of our care to rescue from obscurity
and doubt that ample portion of the scientific writings of Fabricius,
by similar illustrations of the more beautiful and rare species, of
which no figures are extant, as often as we conceive the requisite
variety of our a miscellany will permit<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c015'><sup>[10]</sup></a> their introduction.</p>

<p class='c006'>Papilio Egæa is a native of America; it is a species of that family
which is distinguished by the name of <i>Nymphales Gemmati</i>, having
eyes, or ocellated spots upon all the wings; it is represented in the
annexed plate in a flying posture, as well as in its resting position.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c006'>The Entomologist of the present day must naturally remain
under some uncertainty as to the identity of the Fabrician Papilio
Pylades, since no figure whatever has hitherto appeared in elucidation
of this rare Papilio; and in this instance, as in almost every other,
whatever advantage we may be able to derive from the very accurate
and elaborate descriptions of our author, it would be absurd to deny
that a faithful delineation of the insect described, is not essentially
requisite, in order to determine with perfect satisfaction, the precise
species Fabricius had intended.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, besides the want of a correct delineation, there is yet
another circumstance, not, perhaps, at present known, which might
have tended also to perpetuate this ambiguity, had it not been in our
power to explain it: the intimation of which, it is presumed, will be
considered useful by the scientific Entomologist. Previous to the
time of Fabricius this elegant species had been unnoticed by any
author. Fabricius describes it in his Entomologia Systematica, and
refers for the specimen so described to the Cabinet of Mr. Francillon.
That the insect, to which he adverts, was included in that celebrated
cabinet, we are well assured from our own inspection, but it stood
there unaccompanied by any indication of its being a specimen
described by Fabricius, or even a Fabrician species. The truth is,
that Professor Fabricius, upon this occasion, as in some others, took
his description, not from the specimen itself, but from the drawings
of Mr. Jones, of Chelsea, which had been copied from the specimen
in the cabinet of Mr. Francillon, and it was to the drawing therefore
of Mr. Jones, and not to the specimen of Mr. Francillon’s cabinet
that Fabricius annexed the name of Pylades. Those drawings must
for this reason be now considered as the only positive memorial of the
identity of the Fabrician species, Papilio Pylades, that remains extant
at this time. The figures, it may be added, which are submitted in
the annexed plate, are faithful copies from the original drawings of
Mr. Jones, so inscribed in the hand writing of Fabricius, a circumstance
that must remove every shade of doubt as to the individual
object to which Fabricius had assigned that appellation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Papilio Pylades is a species of the Butterfly tribe, of moderate
size, in comparison with the generality of those which appertain to
the same family, the <i>Equites Achivi</i> of Fabricius. The upper surface
exhibits an appearance of much simplicity and elegance: the
disk is white, and the broad black limb, or border, by which it is
surrounded, is marked with a number of spots and semilunar marks
of white disposed with much regularity. The disk of the lower surface
is also white, but surrounded with a pale brown, or fulvous
limb, and marked with white spots in the same manner as the broad
black border on the upper surface. A few of the white spots on this
fulvous border are surrounded by black lines and spaces. There is
also a red band marked with black and blueish spots, that extends
along the main or anterior rib of the upper wings, from the base, as
far as the middle of the wing, and a spot of red at the base of the
posterior pair.</p>

beautiful of the feathered race, at present known; the general colour
of the plumage, a blue of most transcendant brightness, and highly
changeable, varying from a fine cærulean, or azure, to a green of
equal delicacy and beauty. There is an intermixture of black disposed
in spots throughout; one half of each feather, from the base,
being black, and only the tips blue, so that the plumage appears more
or less spotted with black, as the feathers are ruffled or misplaced from
their natural position. The region of the chin and throat is of a
beautiful crimson purple, whence its name of Purple-Throated
Chatterer. The greater wing coverts are black, varied and spotted
with blue: the quills and tail black with blue margins: the bill black
with the lower mandible rather paler: the legs black.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is a shell far more remarkable for the singularity of its
growth, than for any elegance or beauty of its colouring. The
peculiarity of its character consists in the large, erect, and longitudinal
foliations, which are disposed in three distinct, and nearly equi-distant
series throughout the whole length of the shell: for they appear in
continuity upon every whorl, from the base to the apex. It is from
this peculiarity that the species has obtained the very appropriate
appellation of foliatus, or Foliated Rock Shell.</p>

<p class='c006'>In point of colour, as before observed, the Murex foliatus is
not particularly conspicuous, and they are of a texture so delicate
that it almost constantly occurs in a bleached or depauperated state;
it is also a very fragile shell, and from this cause very liable to be
broken. When in fine condition, as in the example selected, for the
representation now before us, the general hue is a lacteal white; the
body of the shell, externally, a deep tawny, with the foliations whitish,
and the opening, or mouth of the shell, very delicately tinted with a
violaceous hue. Sometimes the foliations have the appearance of fine
white porcelain.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is esteemed a scarce shell, and very rarely occurs perfect,
or in a living state. Found on the sea coast of North America.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c006'>The extraordinary form of this very rare and singular kind
of Murex cannot fail to interest the curious observer. The shell is of
the spiral kind, with an oval aperture; the head of the spire large
or tumid, and the first or body whorl beset with four distinct longitudinal
rows or series of elongated foliations or processes. These
last mentioned appendages are flat and somewhat cylindrical from
the base nearly to their summits, where they become cleft or furcate,
expanding most commonly into two, sometimes three, or rarely four
distinct little lobes, and the radiation of these process by which the
exterior margin of the aperture is encircled, have a groove or canal
extending from the margin of the lip to the cleft or lobate summits.</p>

<p class='c006'>The learned Seba, to whom this very remarkable shell, it
appears, was known, has well observed in speaking of the Murices,
which he describes, that this kind is more particularly distinguished
by the greater disproportion of those advanced processes in comparison
with the size of the body of the shell than any other of his
species; so that their superior length in this respect was, in his
opinion, to be considered truly characteristic of the species.* It is from
these processes it may be also added, that this curious shell has been
variously and not unfrequently fantastically designated by appellations
that cannot very readily be reconciled in our ideas with any object
they have been supposed to resemble, even admitting that latitude of
fancy which may be tolerated when we are entirely aware that the
assimilation is remote. Thus this shell has obtained in various
languages names according with those of the Ragged Spike Whelk,
the Stag’s Horn Whelk, the Skeleton, Water Trough, and others of
no less vague import. The Least Ragged Whelk is a name assigned
to it by our countryman Petiver: the Scorpion Shell is a very old
name for it among the early collectors, it is the Murex Scorpio of
Rumpfius. In France it was distinguished formerly by the name of
<i>Patte de Crapaud</i>, (the Toad’s Foot) because, says the author of
Davila’s Catalogue, besides the spires on the body, the exterior edge
of the lip is bordered with others that are very large and flat at the
extremity, and no doubt, for the same reason it is called by Seba
<i>Bufonis Pedes</i>. It was known at that time also among the collectors
in Holland by the name of the Stag’s Horn,<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c015'><sup>[11]</sup></a> from a remote similitude
which these processes are supposed to bear to the horns of that
quadruped. And lastly, in conclusion it may be added, that for
nearly half a century past it has been distinguished among the
collectors of this country by a title not less whimsical, namely, the
“Water Wheel,” from a fancied similitude the contour of the shell
and its verticillation of processes bear to the circle and lamellar
appendages or sweeps of a water wheel.</p>

<p class='c006'>Not one of any of those various appellations, it must be confessed,
appear so applicable and well chosen as to supersede the
propriety of introducing any other that might be deemed tolerably
appropriate, but upon the whole the species and varieties which
it embraces have been so long known by the name of the Scorpion
Shell, that there can be no great impropriety in allowing it to remain
under that name: we have for our example the authority of Rumpfius,
and the sanction of Linnæus throughout all his works; and in the
Gmelinian System it also stands under the name of Murex Scorpio.
The appellation of the Stag’s Horn Murex, in conformity with the
epithet assigned to it by the old French writers “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>bois de cerf</i></span>,” is not
altogether inappropriate, the elongated processes have much the
appearance of the antlers of the stag, in the first stages of their
growth; or considered in the aggregate, the shell presents a number
of ramose processes like the horns of the Stag or the Rein Deer, and
some other quadrupeds of the Cervine tribe; a characteristic feature
that may perhaps justify the appellation.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are several varieties of this remarkable shell, some of
which might at the first view be considered as distinct species, and in
reality have been occasionally arranged as such by collectors. These
upon the most attentive comparison do not, however, appear to differ
specifically, notwithstanding the differences in point of colour are
very striking. One variety rather exceeds the rest in size, and is of
a deep testaceous or tawny brown colour, or rather inclining to
a chesnut hue: we have seen it of a tawny tint with darker splashes
upon the transverse ribs, particularly on the body and the tumid
whorl of the spire. Occasionally this shell also occurs of a deep or
Ethiopian blackness; this kind is extremely rare. The white variety
occurs more frequently, but is, nevertheless, uncommon in comparison
with the brown or testaceous kind: two examples of the white variety,
clouded with yellow, appears to have occurred in the celebrated
cabinet of the French collector Davilla, about the year 1776. He
distinguishes them by the title of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">deux petites <i>epineuses</i></span>,” and
tells us they have six longitudinal sides like the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rameuses</i></span>,” which
are also named “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pattes de crapaud</span>,” an epithet by which we are
well aware the Linnæan Murex Scorpio was discriminated, and which
therefore leads to a conclusion that the “epineuses” of a white
colour, clouded with yellow, which that cabinet contained, were not
specifically distinct from the shell at present under our consideration.
When extremely fine the white variety of this shell is usually very
delicately tinged with violet in all its shades and transitions of light.</p>

<p class='c006'>All these varieties, as before observed, are very easily reconciled
to the same species; nor is it ourselves alone that are inclined to
this opinion. Seba, to whom the larger brown and white variety, were
known, admits them as the same without any hesitation.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c015'><sup>[12]</sup></a> The expression
“<i>Testa alba aut fusca</i>,” the Linnæan description of this shell
in the cabinet of the Queen of Sweden, implies the like persuasion,
and the authority of Chemnitz may be adduced still further in support
of this opinion: Some modern writers have thought differently, but
we must confess the distinctions they assign are by no means satisfactory
to us. The larger shell is usually of a brown colour, but we
have seen one of the white variety rather larger than any of the
brown colour that have occurred to our notice.</p>

<p class='c006'>The shell we have selected for the figures in the annexed plate
is chosen rather for its extreme perfection than the superiority of
size; we have observed it larger by nearly one half, but have not in
any instance met with one more entirely perfect: it is delineated from
the example of this very curious species in the late Leverian Museum.</p>

<p class='c006'>This species which for a century past or more has maintained
its reputation as a rare production is still held in much esteem, and
bears a price proportionately considerable: it inhabits the shores of
Southern Asia. Gmelin has the expression “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Habitat pretiosus et
rarus in</i> mari, Asiam australem <i>alluente</i></span>, <i>&amp;c.</i>” and describes the
species as being either white, brown, or black.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c006'>This gay little creature is one of the smaller kind of the Psittacus
or Parrot tribe, and of that family which is distinguished by having
the tail short and equal at the end. Its size is rather less than that
of our common house sparrow. The prevailing colour of the plumage
a rich vernal green, deepest in its hues on the back and wings, and
rather paler or more delicate in its tint beneath; the breast and rump
scarlet; the feathers of the latter elongated and extending far over
the tail, which is green; the crown of the head a beautiful Sapphirine
blue. This appears to be the male bird. That which is considered
as the female has a yellow spot upon the throat: it is destitute of
any scarlet spot upon the breast, and the Sapphirine colour on the
crown of the head is also wanting.</p>

<p class='c006'>These are the characteristic distinctions observable generally in
the species; besides which there are other less material particulars in
which these birds are known to differ.</p>

<p class='c006'>In some birds we find a yellow transverse stripe on the hind
part of the neck, varying in colour from luteous to orange, and which
is more or less conspicuous in different individuals. Others have a
somewhat similar band of yellow, but which is situated at the back
of the head instead of the neck. The first of these is distinguished
by the name of the Sapphire Crowned Parrakeet, the other by that of
the Phillippine Parrakeet. Dr. Latham has endeavoured to establish
the characteristic distinctions of these two kinds in his <cite>Index Ornithologicus</cite>:
he considers them as permanent varieties, but we must
confess we regard them rather as accidental than permanent. The
characteristic band of yellow by which they are to be discriminated
chiefly, appears to be more or less developed in different birds at
different periods of their growth; and in the absence of this character
from the back of the head in the Phillippine Parrakeet, or the hind
part of the neck in the Sapphire Crowned Parrakeet, the resemblance
is so very near as to afford no certain means of distinguishing one
from the other.</p>

<p class='c006'>This bird has been long known in Europe. It appeared in the
work of Edwards, the ingenious English Ornithologist, who lived
about the middle of the last century. Linnæus describes the
species with much critical minuteness in the fourth volume of his
<cite>Amoenitates Academicæ</cite>, as <span class='sc'>Psittacus Galgulus</span>, <i>brachiurus
viridis pectore uropygioque coccineis, vertice cæruleo</i>; and this
description accords so exactly with the bird before us, that no doubt
whatever can remain of its being exactly the variety which that
eminent Naturalist has described.</p>

<p class='c006'>Edwards informs us that this bird is a native of Sumatra;
Osbeck met with it in Java, where he tells us it is known by the
name of Parkicki. The title of Perruche de Pérou which it bears in
<i>Pdl. Enl.</i> might induce a persuasion of its being an inhabitant of
South America, which, however, is not believed among Ornithologists.
We have already mentioned that it occurs in the Phillippine Islands,
and that from this locality, the particular variety found there has
obtained the appellation of the Phillippine Parrakeet.</p>

<p class='c006'>We are indebted to Osbeck for a concise description of the
manners of this interesting species when in a state of captivity, “if
put into a cage,” observes this traveller, “it whistles very seldom
and commonly grows quite sullen: it hangs itself with its feet so
that the back is turned towards the earth, and seldom changes this
situation: it is fed with boiled rice; in which manner, in the year
1752, one was brought to Gottenburgh.” It is probably this information
to which Linnæus alludes in his Academic paper, delivered in
1760, where in speaking of the manners of this bird, he tells us
it sleeps on trees, suspended by one foot with its head downwards,
in order to escape the observation of the rapacious birds of night.
The nest of these birds are described by Toreen. “We observed,”
says this writer, “that their nests were remarkable for their exceeding
fine texture, but we did not see the birds. If these nests were differently
constructed, the monkies would be very mischievous to them;
but now, before they can get to the opening, the lowest part, as the
weakest, breaks into pieces, and the visitor falls to the ground without
danger to the young birds.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This bird is observed to be very partial to the fresh juice of the
cocoa tree, which flows from the ends of the branches when the fruit
has been fresh cut off; and which before it undergoes fermentation
is said in taste to resemble new-made cyder.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c006'>Papilio Acamas is one among the number of those Papiliones,
which, from their magnitude, as well as beauty, constitute the more
attractive species of the first family of this interesting tribe, the
<i>Equites Trojani</i> of the Fabrician system. Papilio Acamas is scarcely
surpassed in size by any other of the Papilio genus, and when it is
added, as it may be with confidence, that the figure now presented to
the reader is the first that has appeared in elucidation of such a noble
species, we cannot doubt that its introduction will be received with
pleasure by every Naturalist in this country and throughout Europe.</p>

<p class='c006'>This fine and very striking species has been long since known
by repute to Entomologists; but from the description only which
Fabricius had left us in his <cite>Entomologia Systematica</cite>. Those
conversant with this work of our author, will be aware, that Papilio
Acamas constitutes one of those many species for which Fabricius
refers only to the drawings of the late Mr. Jones: the present figure
is a faithful copy of that original drawing referred to and described
by Fabricius, and as such cannot fail to prove acceptable to every
Entomologist. It is certainly the only figure extant by means of
which the Fabrician species P. Acamas can be ascertained.</p>

<p class='c006'>The identity of this species, it will hence appear, does not rest
upon opinion or conjecture, and this circumstance must be deemed
of no small importance in an enquiry of this nature. In the present
instance it may be also added that this identity is essentially material
to be considered, because there is another insect of the same tribe,
the Papilio Laodocus of the same author, which assimilates so closely
with it, that without due attention, the one might readily be confounded
with the other. These two butterflies, however, although
they appear so nearly allied, present characters which considered
accurately, demonstrate very clearly that Fabricius was right in
separating them. Fabricius adverting to this close affinity, observes,
that in size and appearance Papilio Acamas agrees with Papilio
Laodocus. The predominant colour of P. Acamas, he observes, is a
dark or fuscous brown, much less inclining to black than P. Laodocus.
The anterior wings in both species have a yellow transverse band:
this band in P. Acamas extends from the anterior margin almost
close to the posterior margin, and touches the posterior rib; in P.
Laodocus this yellow band is abbreviated or shorter, of greater
breadth, and placed more immediately towards the middle of the
wing, the band in P. Acamas being situated rather nearer towards
the exterior end of the wing. There is also a marginal series of
yellow spots at the extremity of the anterior wings, the form of
which is very singular, and affords a striking distinctive character
of P. Acamas. There is also a characteristic difference observable in
the markings of the posterior wings: in both species, on the upper as
well as lower surface, those wings are elegantly marked with a distinct
arch of red lunules, posterior to which is another of blue; beyond
these in P. Acamas is a third series of lunules, rather larger than
either of the former, the colour of which is bright yellow. There is
a final or posterior arch of lunules in P. Laodocus, behind the two
series of red and blue lunules, similar to those of P. Acamas, but
they are smaller, and instead of yellow are white. And lastly, the
body in P. Acamas is dark brown above and pale beneath: in P.
Laodocus, on the contrary, the body beneath as well as above is
black, with a longitudinal line each side the body.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have been thus minute in pointing out precisely the differences
that prevail between these two Papiliones, from a persuasion
that they might perhaps be otherwise confounded together, either
as the same species, or as varieties of each other. There is assuredly
a general approximation in the appearance of those two insects,
although they prove so very distinct upon a close and attentive
comparison.</p>

<p class='c006'>Papilio Acamas is a native of Jamaica: Papilio Laodocus of
South America. A figure of P. Laodocus occurs in the work of
Cramer, under the name of Papilio Glaucus.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c006'>In the present instance, as in many others that will occur
during the progress of this undertaking, we have the pleasure of
introducing to the attention of the Naturalist, a species of the Papilio
tribe, no less distinguished for its beauty than its rarity; and one,
moreover, that has never been before depicted in the work of any
author.</p>

<p class='c006'>This magnificent Papilio, for to this appellation it is entitled
truly, was one among the number of those rarities of the insect race
which Fabricius met with in the Entomological Cabinets of the English
Naturalists, when he paid a visit to this country about the year
1792, and the descriptions of which constitute a most invaluable and
extensive portion of the work which he published subsequently upon
the continent, under the title of <cite>Entomologia Systematica</cite>. Fabricius
saw the drawing of this insect in the Collectanea of Paintings formed
by the ingenious hand of that indefatigable and liberal Naturalist
the late William Jones, Esq. of Chelsea, and was so delighted with
its grandeur, as an insect altogether undescribed, that he determined
upon assigning to it some name of pre-eminent distinction. The
tribe of insects to which it naturally appertains in systematic classification,
is that of the <i>Equites Achivi</i>; all the species of which are
named after the Greeks, and more especially of those commemorated
in the Iliad and the Odyssey: the heroes of the Trojan war. This
rule determined his choice, and we may readily conceive his admiration
of the species from the name selected upon this occasion, <i>Papilio
Homerus</i>. If Homer had no claim to be considered as a Greek, he
had sang the achievements of the Grecian heroes, and had mourned
the fall of Troy; and Fabricius disposed alike to compliment the immortal
bard, and define the species by an appellation more than usually
superlative, has consecrated it to the memory of that ancient poet.</p>

<p class='c006'>If we advert to the writings of Fabricius, it will be found that
this author refers for a figure of this fine Papilio solely to the Paintings
of Mr. Jones. The reference is to the eighth drawing of the
first volume of his collectanea. This is perfectly correct, the figure
occurs in that collection of paintings as Fabricius states, and in the
part described. We have not only seen it there with the name
assigned to it in <cite>Entomologia Systematica</cite> <span class='sc'>Papilio Homerus</span>
inscribed in the hand-writing of Fabricius, but are at this time in
possession of an exact copy of that drawing, taken by the express
permission of its former very worthy proprietor; and it is from this
copy of the original drawing so inscribed by Fabricius himself, that
the very beautiful figure is taken which accompanies the present
description.</p>

<p class='c006'>Notwithstanding the general accuracy with which Fabricius
has related the local circumstances connected with the history of the
insects which he describes, there are occasionally errors in this respect
it must be satisfactory to many of our readers to have corrected:
errors, which, owing to the lapse of time and death of those distinguished
Naturalists which Fabricius had the happiness of meeting
with in England, we may venture to presume, without vanity, can
be now corrected only through the medium of our assistance. The
celebrity of Fabricius throughout Europe as one of the best informed
Entomologists of the last century, renders it even of no small importance
to correct the most trivial oversights he has committed; and this
consideration will, we trust, afford us some apology for that minuteness,
if not prolixity with which it may be requisite occasionally to
relate particulars of a local nature, in order to correct such errors.
An instance of this kind occurs in the note annexed to the Fabrician
description of the Papilio now before us; in stating the local circumstances
connected with its history, Fabricius says <i>Habitat in America</i>.
<i>Dom Latham.</i> There is obviously an oversight in this passage,
for we well know that the Fabrician description of this species was
taken from the figure in the series of drawings painted by Mr. Jones,
which has been already mentioned; the original of the figure now
presented by us to the attention of our readers; and that the specimen
of the insect itself from which that painting was taken was preserved
at the time Fabricius described it in the celebrated collection
of the late Mr. Dru Drury. As we had the pleasure of Mr. Drury’s
acquaintance, as well as that of Mr. Jones, and had an unreserved
access to the information and cabinets of both, we are enabled to
speak upon this circumstance with confidence. The example of
Papilio Homerus in the cabinet of Mr. Drury was perfectly familiar
to us, it was ourselves who wrote the name <i>Homerus</i>, annexed to this
insect in that cabinet; and so far as our recollection serves at the
distant period of five and twenty years, Mr. Drury stated to us that
he had received this individual specimen from the Island of Jamaica.
We are in possession of the Entomological manuscripts of this venerable
author, but among those we have in vain sought for any positive
confirmation of this distant recollection. It appears certain that
Mr. Drury had not entered it under the name of <i>Homerus</i> in his
catalogue after we had communicated that name to him; and which
we did upon the authority of the Fabrician manuscripts annexed to
the drawings of Mr. Jones. At the time Mr. Drury received this
insect from his correspondent it was assuredly a nameless species, and
was probably entered as such, with a number only; such omissions in
the nomenclature being, of course, usual when the species proved
to be undescribed, till proper names could be assigned to them. A
gentleman of the name of Keuchan, and another of the name of
Whiting, appear from these entries to be the only correspondents
who furnished Mr. Drury with Papiliones of Jamaica; it was probably
from the former that he obtained this majestic species; and that
Mr. Drury obtained it about the year 1777. This <i>habitat</i> would
justify Fabricius in describing the insect as a native of America,
although if the conclusion be correct, it might have been stated more
distinctly as a native of that island.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the dissolution of the fine collection of that indefatigable
Entomologist, Mr. Drury, which took place by public sale in the
month of May, 1805, this beautiful insect was purchased by
another very eminent collector, Mr. John Francillon, at the price
of <i>four pounds sterling</i>,<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c015'><sup>[13]</sup></a> and subsequently at the death of this last
mentioned individual, which happened in the year 1817, it passed
with many others of the more costly rarities into the cabinet of
Alexander Mc’Leay, Esq. S.L.S. &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c006'>With respect to the Fabrician reference to the cabinet of
Dr. Latham, for it is to the cabinet of the venerable Ornithologist
of that name the reference applies, we believe it is also in our power
to explain its origin, having occasionally, through the kindness of its
proprietor, consulted that cabinet, and finally, in conformity with his
permission, written a catalogue of its contents. In that cabinet we
certainly observed a Papilio allied to P. Homerus, but yet so far
remote from it, that we could not venture to pronounce it the same;
it may be a variety of the species, but is assuredly not the insect
painted by Mr. Jones to which the synonyms of Fabricius
allude.</p>

<p class='c006'>Papilio Homerus is represented in its natural size in the annexed
plate. Its colours are various and very beautifully disposed: the
ground or prevailing colour is a deep or dark brown with a broad
stripe of a yellowish hue across the middle of each wing, forming
very nearly a band of that peculiar kind distinguished among Naturalists
by the appellation of a common band. There is also a large
and somewhat quadrangular spot of the same flavous colour upon
the disk within and contiguous to the band, and beyond, towards the
apex, a small sub-angular band composed of smaller flavous spots.
Behind the yellow band, across the disk of the posterior wings, are a
series of blue spots composed of many little shining points, which in
the aggregate form a distinct spot of an ovate form, most brilliant
towards the centre and paler towards the edge. And finally, there
are three distinct sublunate spots of red on each posterior wing, one
at the anal angle, and the other two at the posterior margin, one of
which is situated on each side near the base of the tail. Beneath,
the anterior wings are uniformly dark with a single pale or whitish
marginal spot at the tip; the lower wings of a fuscous colour with
seven ocellar spots of black, the iris of which are rufous.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c006'>This pretty little species of Manakin is one among the number
of those numerous acquisitions in the science of Natural History, for
which the Naturalist is indebted to the prolific regions of Australasia.
The very close affinity which it bears to the Gmelinian Pipra Nævia,
a species described originally by Buffon under the title of <cite>Fourmilier
tacheté de Cayenne</cite>, may possibly have occasioned some confusion
among authors respecting this individual species, but there are still,
if we mistake not, sufficient indications of the two birds being specifically
distinct. This was the opinion of the late Dr. Shaw: he
constituted a new species of the bird before us under the name of
<span class='sc'>Pipra Punctata</span>, and the english trivial of <span class='sc'>Speckled Manakin</span>,
and we are induced to follow that example from a persuasion that
his conclusion was correct. Pipra Nævia, to which it is so nearly
allied, has the throat and chin black, and the breast spotted with
black: Pipra Punctata, on the contrary, has the throat and breast
yellow, without any black spots. These differences afford a conspicuous
distinction of the two birds, besides which, there are some others
of less consideration that will appear upon an attentive comparison.</p>

<p class='c006'>As a new species, it appears, therefore, pretty certain that we
have to acknowledge the late Dr. Shaw as the first author by whom
this interesting bird was introduced to the knowledge of the learned
world: he describes it, as before observed, under the name of Pipra
punctata. M. Vieillot is consequently in an error when he refers to
authority of Dr. Latham for this name. The bird was so designated
in the first instance, in the work entitled the <cite>Naturalist’s Miscellany</cite>,
written by Dr. Shaw; nor was the species mentioned by Dr. Latham
either in his Synopsis or his Index Ornithologicus. In a final or
second supplement published by Dr. Latham long after the Synopsis,
we find the bird mentioned under the name of the <i>Speckled Manakin</i>,
but only upon the authority of the Naturalist’s Miscellany of Shaw,
and a drawing of the bird by General Davies, for at that late period
even, the bird appears to be unknown to Dr. Latham, except upon
those two authorities. This observation is the more material since
the Ornithologist M. Vieillot in dividing the Linnæan Genus Pipra
into two Genera, Pardalotus and Pipra, assigns for the type of his
genus <span class='sc'>Pardalotus</span> the “<i>Pipra punctata</i>” of Latham, at the same
time, as we have already shewn, the works of Dr. Latham affords us
no such name. The present species was described under the appellation
of <i>Pipra punctata</i> only by Dr. Shaw. Dr. Latham does not
adopt this name, he records the species only under the trivial english
name of the Speckled Manakin, which name had also been assigned
before by Dr. Shaw. If, therefore, the name of Pipra punctata had
occurred to M. Vieillot, it must have been in the work of Dr. Shaw,
and not of Dr. Latham. Perhaps Vieillot had inadvertently imagined
this Speckled Manakin to be the same as the Spotted Manakin
of Dr. Latham’s Synopsis. If this be really the source of error, it
may be added, that this latter bird appears to have been described by
Dr. Latham upon the authority only of Planches Enluminées, and
is no other than Pipra Nævia of Gmelin, as Dr. Latham has himself
pointed out in his Index Ornithologicus.</p>

<p class='c006'>The description of this bird, as it occurs in the first instance, in
the works of Dr. Shaw, is to this effect. <span class='sc'>Pipra punctata</span>
(<span class='sc'>Speckled Manakin</span>) <i>grisea</i>, <i>fusco undulata</i>, <i>vertice alisque
nigris</i>, <i>albo punctatis tectricibus caudæ rubris</i>. The notice of the
species as before-mentioned in Dr. Latham’s second Supplement is
subsequent to this, and appears only under the trivial name of the
Speckled Manakin.</p>

<p class='c006'>In adverting to the separation of the Pipra genus as it occurs
in the work of M. Vieillot, it will not be amiss to point out precisely
those distinctions, which, according to his mode of classification, constitute
the characters of those two genera into which he has divided
them. The first of these genera denominated <span class='sc'>Pardalotus</span> comprehends
those species of the Pipra genus in which the form of the
bill is very short in proportion to its length, a little robust or stout,
the base dilated upon the edges, entire, conoid, thick at the point, the
upper mandible a little bent, and the lower one convex beneath. Those
birds which are allowed to remain in the Pipra genus have the bill
conoid, trigonal at the base, compressed at the sides near the end,
cut off and curved at the point, the lower mandible turning up at the
extremity; and the exterior toes connected rather beyond the middle.
It may be added, finally, that Cuvier, on the contrary, in his <cite>Règne
Animal</cite>, allows the Manakins (Pipra of Linnæus) to remain united
as before. He does not adopt the genus Pardalotus, and this circumstance
is the more worthy of note since we have seen the species
arranged in our Museums with the synonymous appellation of
“<span class='sc'>Pardalotus Punctatus</span> <i>Cuvier</i>,” and have observed it designated
as the type of Cuvier’s New Genus Pardalotus.</p>

<p class='c006'>This interesting little creature being represented in its natural
size in the plate annexed, it will be perceived to be one of the smaller
tribes of the feathered race: we have even few birds in England more
diminutive, for in point of magnitude it does not exceed that of our
common willow-wren, its length being only about four inches. The
elegance of its plumage, is, however, in a peculiar degree attractive,
and more than amply compensates for this inferiority in size. The
general colour above is cinereous brown, varying to a cinereous
purple; the throat and breast a delicate fulvous yellow; the crown
of the head black spotted with white; the wings, except the coverts,
which are the same colour as the back, are black, and the tip of each
of these black feathers are marked with a spot of white. The rump
coverts are testaceous, becoming gradually redder towards the end:
the tail itself is black, having the base of a fine crimson with some
intermixture of yellow; and in general, though not invariably, there
is a white dot at the tip of each of the tail feathers; sometimes it is
only the outer feather on each side the tail that is marked with a
white dot. Beneath, the throat and breast is of a delicate yellow
colour; the bill black, and legs brown.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the plate that accompanies this description, this elegant
little bird appears perched upon a sprig of the <i>ovate leaved Goodenia</i>,
<span class='sc'>Goodenia Ovata</span>, a vegetable production of the Australasian
regions, that flowered in the month of July, during the present year,
in the Royal Gardens, Kew.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c006'>The animal inhabitant of this shell, according to the generical
definition of Linnæus, is a kind of Limax; the Limax is one of the
Mollusca Tribe, or animals furnished with limbs; the mouth is placed
before, it has a lateral perforation, the feelers are four in number, and
the vent common with the lateral pore. This is the Linnæan character
of the animal inhabitant of the Voluta Genus, and consequently
of the species now before us.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is not to be disputed that the discoveries which have taken
place among the vermes of those testaceous bodies since the time of
Linnæus, have introduced us to a far more extensive acquaintance
with the beings of this nature than Linnæus could have possessed.
The term Limax, which Linnæus applied not only to the animal
inhabitants of the Voluta family, but also to the Buccinum, the
Strombus, the Murex, the Trochus, the Turbo, in short to almost
every genus of the Univalves, and some even of the Bivalves could
not fail to excite remark. It could scarcely be conceived that in the
very ample range of the creation which those genera embraced,
such uniformity could prevail, and the subsequent observations of
various Naturalists have tended fully to assure us that the Linnæan
character of the animal inhabitants of the testaceous tribes was much
too vague and comprehensive. There are indeed, it must be confessed,
a considerable number of those testaceous bodies, the animals of which
are still unknown, and may possibly so remain, but forming our conclusions,
from the great multitude that has been recently discovered,
and the number of those which have been examined with anatomical
attention, we may presume, with safety, that the Linnæan Limaces
ought properly to be divided into several distinct genera. How far
a methodical distribution of the shells themselves, founded upon the
zoological distinctions of the animal inhabitants, may be admissible in
our cabinets appears less certain. The greater number of those shells, of
which the animals are totally unknown, present insuperable objections;
and the attention of collectors in the formation of the Conchological
Cabinet, so rarely extend beyond the more obvious characters which the
structure of the shells present, that we can scarcely deem it practicable.</p>

<p class='c006'>The animal of the shell before us, Voluta pyrum, has been
ascertained and well described by Lamarck, De Montfort, and other
writers; it has the head armed with two obtuse feelers of a club-like
form; the eyes advanced and placed at the base, at the outerside of
those feelers; the mantle or fleshy covering terminating in an elongation
folded into a kind of tube above the head; the foot, or disk,
strong and muscular, and armed with a small round horny operculum.</p>

<p class='c006'>According to the Linnæan classification, the shelly covering of
this animal is a Voluta; and so far as the most prominent criterion of
the Voluta genus, the folds or plaits upon the pillar lip be considered,
this character is unequivocal. Linnæus regarding this as one of its
most essential definitions, has overlooked the differences that prevail
in the structure of the spire and beaks, or includes them only as
distinctions of the different families into which his Volutæ are divided.
Later writers differ upon this subject; these differences are considered
by many as generical, and thus the Linnæan Volutæ have become
separated into several distinct genera. In the shell before us, the
beak is lengthened or produced, and canaliculated; and thus constitutes
in the classification of Lamarck, a species of his <span class='sc'>Turbinella</span>;
and is the shell in particular which he adopts as the type of that
genus. The character of that genus, as proposed by this Conchologist,
in his work entitled <cite>Animaux sans vertèbres</cite>, is thus expressed,
Turbinelle (Turbinella) a shell turbinated or subfusiform, canaliculated
to the base, and having upon the column from three to five plaits
or folds of a compressed form and placed transversely. Murex
scolymus of Martini, Voluta ceramica of Lister, and Voluta capitellum
of the same author, are comprehended with the Linnæan
Voluta pyrum in this genus Turbinellus.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been observed by De Montfort that Lamarck has made a
group of those shells which accord with the above character, and which
he himself adopts with some small variations: according to this writer,
the genus Turbinelle, of which our Voluta Pyrum is considered as
the type, has the shell heavy, univalve, with an obtuse spire ending in
a nipple; the mouth sloping and lengthened; the pillar denticulated
with large equal folds or plaits, the outer lip strait and cut off, and
the base lengthened.</p>

<p class='c006'>After all the pains, however, which Lamarck and other Continental
Naturalists have taken to establish the genus Turbinella,
Cuvier in his Règne Animal observes that the shells of this genus
differ in no other respect from the Conic Volutes than in the prolongation
of their opening, forming a kind of canal, and adding that it
is not easy to trace the limits between the one and the other.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have experienced some surprise in observing that while so
much attention has been bestowed by writers upon the generical distinctions
of Voluta Pyrum, the differences that prevail in its presumed
varieties have almost entirely escaped attention. It should be remarked
that in the Gmelinian constitution of this species there are no
less than four distinct varieties, all which, according to Gmelin, and
subsequently to other writers, appertain to the Linnæan species
Pyrum. From the synonymous references which Lamarck has brought
together in one view, it is obvious that his opinion is the same; his
<span class='sc'>Turbinella Pyrum</span>, which is the same as the Linnæan Voluta
Pyrum, will be observed to comprehend the several presumed varieties
of the species to be found in the works of Martini and Chemnitz, and
the same is again observable in the works of Denys de Montfort.
There are, however, some Conchologists in England who do not agree
in this particular, for they constitute at least three distinct species of
the presumed varieties of Voluta Pyrum. This division of the species
was first proposed by Dr. Solander, and has been subsequently
adopted in several of our English Cabinets. As the particulars of
this arrangement may not prove unacceptable, we shall proceed to
describe them.</p>

<p class='c006'>To the <em>first</em> of these new species Dr. Solander retains the
Linnæan name of <span class='sc'>Voluta Pyrum</span>, it is that kind which has the
beak elongated, and is known by the familiar name of the <span class='sc'>Long
Beaked Turnip Shell</span>. This is the Voluta rostrata of some
Conchologists; Rapum rostratum of the Colonnian Museum; and
inhabits the seas of Tranquebar.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the preceding shell is distinguished by the name of the Long
beaked Turnip Shell, in allusion to the elongated structure of the
beak, there is another known by the appellation of the High Spired
Turnip Shell, in reference to the greater elevation of its spire; this
is a <em>second</em> species of Solander, and is called by him <span class='sc'>Voluta
Ponderosa</span>; in the Calonnian Museum it stood under the name
of Rapum productum. This shell inhabits the seas of Madagascar,
and is the kind which becomes the more immediate object of our
consideration as the subject of our present plate.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <em>third</em> kind of Turnip Shell is from the straits of Malacca,
a shell more ponderous than the preceding; of a broader form and
having the spire more depressed. This is the common Heavy Turnip
Shell of our English Cabinet, Voluta gravis of Solander.</p>

<p class='c006'>These distinctions proposed by the late Dr. Solander are found
conformable, in a particular degree, with the classification observable
in the cabinet of M. de Colonne. The shells of M. de Colonne, it
appears, were thus arranged by the celebrated Conchologist
M. Favanne. They have, nevertheless, we believe, passed unnoticed
by any of the modern writers upon this subject. The distinctions
are certainly obvious, and might probably fully authorize their separation
into species: it must be at least admitted that as varieties of
the same species they are strikingly distinct.</p>

<p class='c006'>Having so far treated upon the generical distinctions of Voluta
Pyrum, and pointed out the differences that exist among its principal
supposed varieties, we arrive at another point of view in which the
history of this shell becomes no less important, or less worthy of our
consideration: the sacred character which from some superstitious
causes, remote beyond all research of the present race of men, this
shell has acquired in the Mythology of the Indian Nations: in the
rites and worship of the Indian Brahma. Among these people this
shell is called the <span class='sc'>Chank</span>, or <span class='sc'>Sacred Chank</span>, the emblem of an
attribute of the divine power, and is constantly seen in one of the
hands of the Indian Deity Vishnu, as a type of the renovation of the
earth from the waters of the deluge.—The cause of this catastrophe
of the earth, the deluge, they attribute to the wickedness of mankind
in remote ages, which incensing the divine Brahma, he caused a
flood of the waters to overflow the earth and destroy every vestige
of the creation, animate and inanimate, that existed upon its surface.
After awhile the supreme Brahma disposed to restore creation, commanded
Vishnu to deliver the earth from the flood of waters, and in
testimony of its deliverance Vishnu bears in his hand the Chank Shell,
the symbol of its renovation.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c015'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Without proceding at any considerable length into the history
of those mythological persuasions, it may be permitted to observe
that as a type of the divine power in relieving the earth from the flood
of waters with which it was overwhelmed at the time of the deluge,
this shell is held among the Indians of the Brahma persuasion as one
of the most sacred emblems of that figurative divinity; and this
religion, it will be remembered, extends over no small portion of India
and China, and even to part of Russia and Tartary. Vishnu, as one
of the three attributes or triad of Brahma, almost invariably appears
with this symbol in his hand. Whether in their paintings, sculptures,
or carvings, or in the sacred paraphernalia of their temples, the
Chank-shell is the customary type of their deity Vishnu, and sometimes
it occurs in the hands of the inferior deities,<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c015'><sup>[15]</sup></a> to whom Vishnu
is imagined to have confided a portion of his power. If the Chank
be the object of their devotion in health, so also it is the object of
their superstitions in sickness and in death. The medicine administered
by the Priest to his patient in the time of illness, from the spout
of one of these shells, is considered of greater efficacy than if taken
from any other drinking vessel; that from the spout of a reversed
shell has a reputation inestimable. These reversed shells occur so
rarely, that if at any time some happy fortunate of the fishing tribe
of Hindoos should be so lucky as to find one, he is indeed considered
as a mortal favoured by their divinity Vishnu; this treasure of the
deep is immediately deposited in one of their pagodas, to the great
honour and happiness of the discoverer. A dose of medicine from
such a shell is deemed infallible, if the malady of the patient be
within the art of medicine to cure; for if this should fail, they
rest persuaded nothing else can save the patient from the death
awaiting him.</p>

<p class='c006'>As these reversed shells are of very rare occurrence, the price
they bear is of course of considerable. Very few of the Pagodas
possess such an inestimable treasure as a <i>Chank reversed</i>, they will
command a price in Asia surpassing infinitely any idea that might
probably be formed upon the subject. Four or five hundred dollars
have been given in China, among the worshippers of Brahma, for a
shell of this kind. In India they have been known to produce from
one hundred to two hundred rupees, sometimes, three, four, or five
hundred rupees, or perhaps a larger sum. The shells of this kind,
which are purchased from the natives and brought to Europe, it
may be imagined, for this reason, can have been obtained only at a
considerable cost. It was principally through the unrivalled liberality
of the Conchologists of the low countries, about the beginning of the
last century, that the cabinets of Europe became possessed of these
rarities, and they still remain extremely scarce.</p>

<p class='c006'>Only two examples of those reversed shells have occurred to our
observation: both were of that kind in which the spire is elongated;
the high spired Turnip Shell of the English cabinets. One of these
reversed shells we saw in the year 1797, in the celebrated collection
of Mon de Calonne, ci-devant Minister of France, and which passed,
at a considerable price, into the collection of the Earl of Tankerville.
The other occurred in the late Leverian Museum, which was distributed
by public auction, in the year 1806. This last-mentioned
shell was in a less perfect condition than might be wished; it was
worn and mutilated, and for this reason did not obtain by any means
such a price as was expected from its rarity: it produced only <i>seven
guineas</i>, a sum considered much beneath its real value, even in its
injured state.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c015'><sup>[16]</sup></a> In the month of April, in the year 1815, the same
shell appeared in the sale of certain effects, the property of the
Duke de Bourbon, at his residence in Great Ormond Street, Portman
Square, where it was sold, we believe, at an advanced price. It
is the figure of this last-mentioned shell that appears in the present
plate. We have delineated the specimen with all faults for the sake
of greater accuracy, and from a persuasion that the Naturalist would
prefer a correct representation from an undoubted original, to any
figure in which its actual defects might have been amended by the
pencil of the artist. The shell is depicted in its natural size, and it
will hence appear, is little inferior in point of magnitude to the
generality of those shells of the same species which are not of the
reversed kind. The species is sometimes known to grow to the
length of seven or eight inches, but such examples are not common.
Of the reversed kinds the Leverian specimen, as it has been emphatically
denominated, is probably one of the largest known.</p>

<p class='c006'>The smaller figure in the lower part of our plate is a representation
of the same species in its usual form, and appears clothed or
covered with the thick filmy epidermis, of a brown colour, with which
the shell is naturally covered when in a living state. From this
figure it will be perceived that the direction of the spiral wreath or
whorls in the larger shell is exactly reversed, and that the mouth or
aperture of the shell, which in the smaller figure appears on the right
side, is seen in the reversed shell on the left. Thus upon the least
comparison of the two figures, the true character of the reversed shell
will be distinctly perceived.</p>

<p class='c006'>We should not omit to mention that the smaller figure which
represents the unreversed shell would appear of the same pallid hue
as the reversed shell, upon the removal of the epidermis with which
it is enveloped. Sometimes, however, when this common kind is
particularly fine, the exterior surface is delicately tinged with a less
pallid hue, and the pillar lip and opening yellowish, inclined to flesh
colour. That particular kind or variety which in England is denominated
the low spired or heavy Turnip Shell, is sometimes pleasingly
diversified with more vivid tints, and the younger shells occasionally
spotted with brown, upon a ground tinged with yellowish or buff
colour. We have no knowledge of any reversed shell of this latter
kind, excepting one which is in the Museum at Copenhagen.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the preceding plate (<a href='#p021'>plate 21</a>) we have introduced to the
attention of our readers a figure of that truly interesting rarity the
reversed Voluta Pyrum, or Pear Volute, or as it is better known in
the familiar language of the English collectors by the appellation of
the High spired Turnip Shell. The figure there delineated exhibits
a frontal view of this shell, in which the characteristic aperture of

<p class='c006'>The history of this splendid species of Tanager is unknown to
Naturalists: we are aware only, that independently of the varieties
arising from its different states of plumage, there are two pretty
distinct and accurately defined varieties, one of which has the head
of a fine green, the other of a rich blue. Some authors consider
these two birds as specifically different, while others are as well
assured they are the same. Dr. Latham observes that these birds
are, without doubt, the same, differing only in sex, but which of
them is the male is not ascertained. Some of the French writers,
among whom is Vieillot, express a different opinion, for they assure
us neither the female or the young are known, and they further add,
that in the Brazils this bird is common, while in Guiana it is rare.
Vieillot once regarded them as distinct species, but has subsequently
described them as the same. Both birds, according to Dr. Latham,
are from Cayenne; we have seen both kinds from the Brazils.</p>

<p class='c006'>The size of this bird is that of the house sparrow: the rump is
usually green, but in the blue headed variety, is sometimes flavous,
more or less inclined to orange.</p>

<p class='c006'>We may venture to affirm, with every degree of certainty, that
there is no figure of this very beautiful species, extant, in the work
of any previous author. Fabricius described it as a new species,
under the name of Papilio Thersites; his description refers to a specimen
in the cabinet of Dr. Hunter, but he has omitted to insert his
usual reference to the drawings of Mr. Jones, among which that
specimen was delineated, and from which we are well aware the
Fabrician description of the species is derived. It is from those
drawings, also, that we have been enabled to determine the species
with perfect accuracy.</p>

<p class='c006'>The magnitude of this Papilio renders it an object of peculiar
interest; it is one of the most conspicuous insects of its tribe, and in
point of elegance cannot assuredly be considered inferior to any of its
numerous species. In the plate accompanying this description, the
Papilio is represented in its natural size: the whole disk is of a fine
yellow colour, with a deep black border: the posterior wings are
marked with a series of yellow lunules, and another of brilliant blue
spots, composed of little shining dots, of which the brightest are in
the centre. Beneath, the breast, abdomen, and wings, are yellow:
margin of the anterior pair black with a yellow streak, and a black
streak of spots on the lower pair.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c006'>The Tufted-Neck Humming Bird described by Buffon under
the name of <i>l’Oiseau-Mouche de Cayenne</i>, <i>Le Hupecol de Cayenne</i>,
differs in no respect that we perceive from the bird before us; and
for this reason we can have no hesitation in considering it as an individual
of the same species. Our specimen is not from Cayenne, it
was brought from New Zealand, and was one among the number of
those rarieties collected in that island by the celebrated Navigator
Captain Cook, in his first voyage round the world: that in which he
was accompanied by Sir Joseph Banks, and Dr. Solander. The New
Zealand specimen, though it nearly accords with the bird described by
Buffon under the name of Hupecol de Cayenne, does not entirely
agree with the description given of that species by Dr. Latham: it
differs in wanting the white band on the rump, and the patch or
space of the same colour on the lower region of the belly. Buffon
speaks of such a characteristic mark of white on the rump, but not
the abdomen of the Cayenne kind.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c015'><sup>[17]</sup></a> And it is not unlikely that
these appearances may be indications only of a change in plumage,
as the same circumstance is not unfrequently observed in many other
birds at particular seasons, or in certain states of moulting. Dr. Latham
himself observes that in the female these marks, instead of being
white, incline to rufous, and this, no doubt, in the adult bird. There
is certainly no appearance of white either upon the rump or region of
the belly in the bird before us; and this example bears every appearance
of having arrived at its full maturity of plumage. Perhaps the
bird from Cayenne having a white band on the rump and abdomen,
may be, however, if not a distinct variety, the more mature bird
of the same species as that met with by our circumnavigators at
New Zealand.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are species of this tribe more brilliant in colour and more
richly varied in the disposition of those colours, but assuredly none
more singular or pleasing in general aspect than the bird before us.
In point of size the Tufted Humming Bird is one of the smallest species
of its family, scarcely exceeding in that respect the figure delineated in
the plate, for its total length is not above three inches, and its bulk
proportionate. The head and upper part of the body, and also
the wings above, are green with a golden lustre; the tail greenish,
changeable to testaceous golden brown, and having the inner webs
rufous. The throat is of a fine green colour, variable in different
lights to a golden hue with a yellow or a brown metallic lustre, and
below that the whole of the belly is a rich brown glossed with green
and golden. On the head of the male bird is a crest of pointed feathers
of an orange or testaceous brown colour, and on each side of the
neck a tuft composed of elongated feathers, differing in length, and
having the tips of a dark but brilliant green. These feathers the
little creature has the power of raising or depressing at pleasure:
when these are displayed in full array on each side of the green patch
on the front of the neck, and the crest stands erect, which is invariably
the case when the bird is offended or surprised, the appearance
of this bird is altogether remarkable. The female has neither the
ruff on the neck nor the crest, and its colours are in general more
obscure than in the male. The bill is of a moderate length and
straight, the legs very short and the feet diminutive.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c015'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c006'>The Wentletrap is one of those extraordinary productions of
the shell tribe that has been regarded with unabated admiration
among Conchologists from the days of Petiver and Rumpfius, the
earliest of the more recent race of Naturalists, down to the period in
which we live. And, although it does not at this time bear a price
so very great as that which it bore some years ago, it is yet considered
as a shell of no mean value when it is large and in fine perfection:
even those of a smaller size, when in good condition, are
esteemed of value, at least in some proportion to those more estimable
for their perfection.</p>

<p class='c006'>The rarity of this choice and very curious shell arises from
various causes. In the Chinese seas, which it chiefly inhabits, the
species is very rare; it sometimes occurs upon the coasts of Coromandel,
but sparingly, and in the other seas upon the coasts of India
it is believed to be still more uncommon. These shells are, moreover,
so very brittle that they seldom occur perfect, and more especially
the larger ones, which in almost every instance is abbreviated or imperfect
at the point or apex. And, it may be also added that like
<i>Voluta Pyrum</i>, the <i>Sacred Chank Shell</i>, of which an explanation was
given in a former plate, the Wentletrap is one of the sacred shells
of the worshippers of Brahma, and consequently when found in fine
condition, is sure to obtain a considerable price among the opulent
devotees of that doctrine, the prevailing worship of the many millions
of inhabitants that people India, China, and other vast regions of the
continent of Asia. In China, shells of this kind, of a moderate size,
are valued at from four to five, or even ten dollars a piece, those are
shells of about an inch and a quarter in length, and such as exceed
that size are considered in proportion valuable. In England a fine
specimen about the same size last mentioned would be estimated
in worth at little less than five guineas. The celebrated Wentletrap
of the Leverian Museum was about two inches long, but as it
exhibited little freshness of colour, it produced only eleven pounds.
Since that period another specimen, a trifle larger, and with the same
bleached or depauperated appearance in its tints of colour, was sold
at the public hammer for twenty seven pounds. This is the highest
price we have seen paid for a specimen of this curious shell: we have
heard of fifty guineas being given by one collector for a shell of this
kind. Considerable as this price may be deemed, it appears to have
been exceeded in one, if not more instances, upon the continent.
Denys de Montfort, speaking, as it may be presumed, of the low
countries and France, informs us, that he has seen it sell, when the
height or length has exceeded two inches, at two thousand four hundred
livres, or one hundred Louis. It will be observed that he is
alluding to shells about the same size as that delineated in the
annexed plate, the outline of which is from the Leverian specimen;
the colouring amended from a smaller but more recent shell.</p>

<p class='c006'>These shells are of such a tender nature, and their colours so
evanescent or so feebly fixed, that they almost constantly present a
mutilated and bleached appearance. This is not, however, uniformly
the case; we have very recently had an opportunity of inspecting
several specimens of a moderate size, that were brought from China,
and from these we perceive that the Wentletrap, when in fine
order, is of a pale testaceous or rather fulvous hue; and inclining
sometimes to yellowish. In some few specimens the ground colour
of the shell, instead of being uniform, appears sprinkled with pallid
spots and dots of a rounded form. Sometimes we are assured the
colour inclines to rufous, or a reddish tint. Lamarck has this shell
of a pale fulvous colour, with the ribs as usual, white, for he adopts
this as part of the leading character of the species; his expression
is “<i>pallide fulva</i>; <i>costis albis</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The animal inhabitant of this shell has the head armed with two
feelers, each ending in a setaceous thread or hair: the eye is placed
upon the tentacula at the base of this thread or hair, and it has also
a kind of trunk at the mouth, by means of which it searches for its
food amongst the sand and weeds. It is supposed to be of a carnivorous
nature, subsisting on other marine worms. It is considered
rather as a littoral species, frequenting the little sandy bays and
creeks among the breakers upon the lower parts of the sea shore,
and is to be sought for with the most probability of success among
the sea weeds or fuci that grow in the pools of water lying in
these sunken rocks, because in such situations it is most likely to
find protection against the intrusion of the boisterous element.
Occasionally it is seen, though rarely, crawling on the sands at
low water.</p>

<p class='c006'>In a natural classification of the shell tribe, should we ever
arrive at an arrangement of Conchology, so perfect as to deserve that
epithet, it would be a task of some difficulty to fix the precise station
of the Wentletrap; for in the order of nature it presents anomalies
which cannot easily be reconciled, and few authors are agreed upon
this subject even in the artificial arrangements which they have been
induced to adopt. Thus Rumpfius makes it a <i>Buccinum</i>, Davila
a <i>Tuyau</i>, Argenville places it as a <i>Terebra</i> (vis) and De Montfort
Scalarus. In the Encyclopædia it is denominated Scalaria Pretiosa,
and this name Lamarck retains.</p>

<p class='c006'>The name of Wentletrap, by which this shell is now so well
known, is derived from the Dutch Language, and signifies according
to the technical phraseology of the Dutch architects in building, a
winding stair case, or flight of stairs turning spirally round a central
column, into which one end of every step is mortised as they ascend
from the base upwards. The term Wentletrap, Wenteltrap, or
as the Dutch sometimes call it, Wendeltrap,<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c015'><sup>[19]</sup></a> is the name given by
Rumpfius the Hollander to this shell, as a synonymous name with his
latin term <i>Scalare</i>. It is an allusion, somewhat fanciful we must allow,
to the disposition of the costal ridges upon this shell, and which when
viewed laterally as they traverse or pass over the upper convexity of
the whorls on each side, have the appearance of a flight of steps turning
spirally round the body of the shell, just as a winding staircase would
be carried spirally round a cone or sub-cylindrical body. The singularity
of this species (for it is not a peculiarity or character even of
the new genus Scalaria as established by Lamarck and Cuvier)
consists in having the whole whorl of the shell, from the mouth
to the summit, entirely unconnected, while in spiral shells the suture
of the whorls is united throughout. The tube is perfectly detached
from the mouth to the apex, and the whorls linked together only by
means of the longitudinal ribs which traverse the tube at regular
intervals, so that the only connexion of the whorls is at the junction
of those ribs, which touching each other unite at that part which in
regular spiral shells that have the whorls united, would be denominated
the suture of the whorls.</p>

<p class='c006'>Considering the very zealous propensity of some French Naturalists
of the present day, and of their admirers in England, to
create new genera upon every slight occasion, it becomes a matter
of some astonishment that a character so very obvious as the disjunction
of the tube from the aperture to the very summit should not
have laid the foundation of a new genus, for the reception of this
shell. Lamarck, however, places it at the head of his <i>Scalaires</i>, and
one of the next species in succession is his <i>Scalaria Communis</i>, a
shell perfectly well known by every Naturalist throughout Europe for
nearly a century past under the name of <i>Turbo Clathratus</i>.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c015'><sup>[20]</sup></a> Nor is
Lamarck singular in this very anomalous consolidation of shells so
distant in this respect from each other; for Cuvier in his <cite>Règne Animal</cite>,
after describing our present shell, the Linnæan Turbo Scalaris, as one
of his <i>Scalaires</i>, and informing us it is distinguished by the whorls
not touching each other, adds particularly that there is another species
which has not that peculiarity, and that is the <i>Turbo Clathratus</i>.
Nothing, however, can be more certain than that from this very circumstance
these two shells are generically distinct from each other;
Clathratus may be retained with the Linnæan Turbines, but Scalaris
has nearly, if not entirely as much claim to the <i>Serpula</i><a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c015'><sup>[21]</sup></a> as <i>Turbo</i>
genus; which cannot be said of T. Clathratus. We shall for this
reason allow the Wentletrap to remain where Linnæus has placed it,
namely, among the Turbines; not perhaps without some hesitation,
but if we did remove it, we should certainly prefer the institution of
new genus for its reception, instead of wandering from one anomaly
to another, as we must perceive would be the case in the present
instance by following the example of Lamarck and Cuvier.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be lastly observed that the progressive growth of this
extraordinary rarity may be determined by the greater number of the
longitudinal ribs that pass over and surround the tube of the whorls,
for at each increase the animal forms a new mouth to its shell: the
new mouth as it is protruded and formed, appears like the former
ones, entirely surrounded by a rim or ring, and it is these rings of
the mouths as they are formed in succession, that constitute the ribs
which appear to traverse the shell as it is increased in length, and
consequently in the number of its rings. Shells of a large size exhibit
sometimes as many as fifty or sixty of such rings surrounding the
tube or spire at regular intervals.</p>

<p class='c006'>It cannot fail to prove satisfactory to the Naturalist to be informed
that we have the same sanction for presenting the annexed
figure as that of the true <span class='sc'>Papilio Zacynthus</span> of <i>Fabricius</i>, as
that to which we have several times adverted upon other similar
occasions in the progress of the present publication, namely the hand-writing
of that celebrated Entomologist, inscribed upon the original
drawings of Mr. Jones. This is indeed a circumstance to which we
cannot advert too frequently in our references, since it is upon that
authority alone that we are now enabled to determine with any degree
of precision nearly the whole of those new species of Papiliones, the
existence of which has been made known throughout Europe by the
classic writings of that author, but of which no other evidence is now
extant; for most of the collections existing at the time Fabricius was
in England, and to which he refers, have been long since dispersed,
and but for the care of the late Mr. Jones of Chelsea, who had
preserved these invaluable authorities to the scientific world, the
labours even of Fabricius in this department had become comparatively
of very little value.</p>

<p class='c006'>Papilio Zacynthus is a species of the first family of Papiliones,
the Equites Trojani. It has much the habit of Papilio Æneas, a
well known insect, described by Linnæus, and which is figured by
Roesel, Seba, Jablonsky, and some other authors; but upon an
attentive comparison it will be found to be very different. Its great
similarity renders it of more importance to point out precisely the
difference that prevails between them, and this the present figure it
is presumed will render distinctly obvious.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the species P. Zacanthus the wings are black: in the middle
of the first pair is a large spot composed of two distinct colours, the
anterior part being white, the posterior green, but on the underside
the spot appears entirely white. Papilio Æneas has also a spot of
green upon the anterior wings but without any portion of white.
Papilio Æneas is a native of India, Papilio Zacynthus is from the
Brasils.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c006'>This, like the preceding, is a species we have been enabled to
determine from the Fabrician MS. and the drawings of Mr. Jones.
Fabricius, it appears, was not entirely decided in his mind whether
the two Papiliones figured by Cramer, plate 29 fig. <span class='fss'>E</span>, under the
name of Hyppason, and that in the same plate, fig. <span class='fss'>F</span>, named Euristeus,
ought in reality to be considered as appertaining to this species; and
preferring the name of Dimas which had been previously given to it
by Mr. Jones, he has described it under that name, allowing the
references to Cramer, above quoted, to remain as synonyms. The
Naturalist may rely with implicit confidence upon its being the
Papilio Dimas of Jones and Fabricius.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is rather larger than the former, the general colour black:
on the anterior wings, in the middle, is a large white spot, so situated
upon the junction of the ribs that they pass distinctly through it and
give the appearance of a spot cleft at the sutures. The sanguineous
palmate spot on the posterior wings is six cleft: and besides this there
is a small spot of red upon the scollops, between the dentations at
the margin of the posterior wings. The colours and spots appear
beneath as above, but only paler.</p>

<p class='c006'>Papilio Dimas is a native of Brazil, and bears a near affinity to
Papilio Anchises.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c006'>The singular object now before us, a shell no less remarkable
for the peculiarity of its form than rarity of occurrence, is one of the
most choice productions of the seas surrounding the Friendly Isles.
The discovery of this shell, like that of many others, resulted from
the assiduities of that eminent Naturalist and promoter of scientific
knowledge, the late Sir Joseph Banks, and of Dr. Solander, who
accompanied him in that memorable voyage of Captain Cook to the
Southern Hemisphere, in which the Friendly Isles were discovered.
The fine example of this shell, in particular, from which the drawing
in our plate is taken, it may be also added, was one of those which
were brought to this country by Captain Cook upon the return of
the expedition, and which being shortly after presented to Sir Ashton
Lever, remained in the Museum of that distinguished amateur from
that period to the time of its dissolution in the year 1806.</p>

<p class='c006'>When we consider the very remote situation of those islands,
so distant from the usual track of all navigators, we cannot be
surprised, admitting the species to be local in those seas, to find it
has remained a very rare shell from the period of its discovery to the
present time. In the course of many years only a few specimens have
occurred to our observation, and while it has remained scarce with
us, it appears to have been still more uncommon in the continental
cabinets: very few of which, if we are informed correctly, were lately
in possession of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first difficulty that arises in the mind of the naturalist upon
the inspection of this shell results from the ambiguity of its generical
peculiarities: we pause to consider where it should be placed.
Linnæus, to whom, as it will be observed, the present shell was
totally unknown, arranged the Hammer Shell, its nearest approximation,
among the Ostreæ. The Hammer Shell, or as it is more usually
denominated the Hammer Oyster Shell, had been discovered before
the time of Linnæus; it had appeared in the work of Rumpfius,
Seba, Gualtieri and Argenville, and the shell had been examined and
described by him in the Museum of Ulrica, Queen of Sweden, under
the name of Ostrea Malleus. That the hinge accords in some degree
with that of the Ostreæ generally must be admitted, at the same time
that it possesses other characters less easily reconciled to that genus,
unless we embrace the Linnæan genus in all its latitude, and to this
the conchologist of the present day cannot accede, at least without
some little difficulties.</p>

<p class='c006'>The conformation of this shell is very striking, and yet we
perceive that its essential characteristics are less definitive than could
be wished; there are several approximations in the general figure to
be found among shells which nevertheless possess characters generically
distinct. For many years this shell was known in this country
under the name of “<i>Margaritifera maculata</i>,” and the trivial
English appellation of the “<i>Spotted Hound’s Tongue</i>:” it appeared
under those names in the Conchological Museum of M. de Calonne,
while it remained in England, and in the catalogue of that museum,
which is still extant, it will be found under those names. The
epithet of Hound’s Tongue is not inaptly applied to this shell, in
allusion to the elongated form. The term Margaritifera does not
refer to the form, but to the pearly gloss that appears upon the
surface of the dark blue space lying within the shell, immediately
below the hinge, and extending from thence about one fourth part
of its whole length. This is the region in which the animal is
attached by its ligament to the valves of the shell; besides which, a
gloss of pearly hue is observed to pervade the whole of the inner
surface, only that it is most conspicuous in the darker disk of the
shell. As a secondary character this pearliness is very remarkable in
the shell before us, at the same time that as a generical denomination
the term Margaritifera assigned to it from this circumstance alone is
liable to objection; because, the same pearliness prevails in many
shells which have no relation whatever with the present, either in the
form or structure of the hinge, and it is to these we must resort for
its true essential character.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lamarck constitutes many genera of the shells included in the
Ostrea genus of Linnæus. His Malléacées comprehend five genera,
Crenatula, Perna, Malleus, Avicula, and Meleagrina, all which are
allied more or less remotely to the shell before us. To that particular
family which is known among collectors by the designation of Hammer
Oysters, he gives the name of Malleus, in the French Marteau, both
alike implying the hammer like form of the species Malleus, which
Lamarck assumes as the type of this genus. But even there after
all the renovation that has been attempted, the result is not
satisfactory, because this figure is by no means constant, even in the
few species included by its author in that genus; it contains but six
species, and these are entirely at variance with each other. Thus for
example, in Malleus Vulgaris, the common Hammer Shell, we have
a species with three lobes, a lateral one of considerable size being
advanced on each side the beaks: and another shell of the same
species with only short lateral lobes instead of large ones. Admitting
the hammer form to be still preserved in these, in the next species,
Malleus Normalis, instead of two lobes, the hammer head, if it may
be so expressed, has but a single lobe: in Malleus Anatinus there is
only one lobe, and that very small; and in Malleus Vulsellatus,
although characterised as “<i>lobo oblique porrecto</i>,” the appearance of
the shell implies rather the total absence of any lobe, for the lobe, if
so it may be termed, is so indefinite, that it cannot be referred without
violence to the genus Marteau, while we consider its hammer
like form as a leading character of the genus. With exception to
this inconstant character which may be qualified with the expression
“deformed and generally hammer shaped,” we have no objection to
the Malleus genus, because the byssus of the animal by means of
which it can affix itself to other bodies, and the peculiar sinus or
sulcation of the hinge through which the byssus passes from the
animal to those extraneous bodies, are sufficient to remove it from
the Ostrea genus, in which case if we still adhere to the Linnæan
method we can place it only among his Mytili or Pinnæ, and it has
certainly less affinity with either of those than with Ostrea. Perhaps
the name of Perna under which this shell has been mentioned a few
years ago might have been as well preserved, but that name Lamarck
assigns to an extensive genus of which Ostrea Isognomum is the
type, and it is therefore better to retain the name Malleus than to
alter it to another which could not fail at this time to create confusion.
The same consequence would as unquestionably result were
we to sub-divide the Malléacées into different genera according to the
configuration of the shell or number of its lateral lobes.</p>

<p class='c006'>The definition of Malleus in the <cite>Règne Animal</cite> of Cuvier appears
to intimate the same objection; it does not consider the hammer like
form of the shell as any criterion, it is only stated that the Marteaux
are inequivalve and irregular, that they have a simple hollow for the
ligament as in the oysters, but that they are distinguished by a slope
at the side of the ligament for the passage of the byssus.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is assuredly true that the presence of a byssus in this tribe of
shells displaces them from any immediate analogy with the Ostrea,
where as Cuvier remarks “Linnæus left them.” But, if however, we
attentively examine the hinge of the common oyster, the two valves,
and the oyster as it lies within the valves, we shall perceive with this
exception a pretty near approximation. The great objection is, that
the animal of the tribe of shells now before us protrudes a byssus
from its body through a lateral opening on one side or slope of the
ligament of the hinge; if we closely inspect the valves of the oyster,
we also find a slight depression or hollow upon each side of the cartilage
of the hinge; these are small, and usually somewhat lamellar.
The oyster, moreover, as it lies in the shell, seems capable of expanding
or spreading that part of the body which lies under the hinge
laterally upon and into these depressions, a circumstance very easily
observed in the half famished oyster, because these lateral expansions
of the animal are then more visibly elongated along the passage of
these lateral grooves of the hinge, and give the pointed end of the
animal a somewhat cornuted appearance. Under the same circumstance
these processes adhere as they lie in the hollow of these grooves,
and thus suggests the idea of the animal having exerted itself by
such extension to obtain refreshment through these lateral hollows.
Those hollows are also so far pervious as to admit the ingress of
moisture while the shells are closed, in the same manner as it is
possible the Malleus genus may receive moisture under the same
circumstance through the sinus, whence the byssus is protruded.
These peculiarities considered, may perhaps afford some further
justification of Linnæus in placing the hammer shells with the Ostreæ.
It has been indeed advanced that Linnæus was not aware of these
hammer shells being furnished with a byssus, or that he would have
referred them to the Mytili, but this observation cannot be correct,
because in the figure given of these shells by Seba, to which Linnæus
refers, the byssus, which is very conspicuous, is represented pendent
or hanging to a considerable length out of the shell.</p>

<p class='c006'>From an attentive examination of the different Conchological
authors, it does not appear to us that the shell before us has hitherto
been figured, and we have reason also to believe that it has never
been described. These circumstances are the more probable since,
as we have before observed, the shell is at this time very little known
among the Continental Cabinets. The nearest approach, so far as we
can judge from the description, unassisted by any figure, is the Marteau
Normal (Malleus Normalis) of Lamarck, a species defined by him as
<i>testa biloba</i>; <i>lobo basis unico anticali ad normam</i>, our shell is certainly
bilobate, for it has only one lateral lobe at the beak, and that moreover
advances from the beak, pretty nearly, though not exactly, in
a right line; but its general description does not sufficiently accord
with our shell to authorise as a conclusion that they are the same.
Lamarck informs us that there are two varieties of his Malleus
Normalis, one of which is a native of the ocean of the Great Indies,
the other of the seas of New Holland. The first, or Indian kind, he
describes as being on the inside as well as outside of a black colour,
with a longish lobe at the base of the shell.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c015'><sup>[22]</sup></a> The New Holland
kind is described of a whitish colour, with the lobe at the base
abbreviated.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c015'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The two last-mentioned shells which Lamarck concludes to be
varieties of the same species, may perhaps prove hereafter to be
species distinct from each other, as Lamarck has himself shewn to be
the case with respect to the common black and the white hammer
shells. The black supposed variety of Malleus Normalis we apprehend
to be distinct from the shell before us, but it is possible that the
New Holland shell which he describes as being whitish, with the lobe
at the base abbreviated, may be a worn or much depauperated specimen
of our present shell; it certainly does not accord with our
shell in any tolerable state of preservation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lamarck says nothing of any ruddiness or testaceous hues in
his New Holland variety of <i>Normalis</i>, and admitting these colours to
indicate that the shell had been found with its animal in a living state,
we can scarcely conceive the dark fuscous spotting which is so conspicuous
in the species could by any ordinary accident be so entirely
obliterated as appears to be the case in Lamarck’s specimen, if his
New Holland variety of Malleus Normalis be really of this species;
and it may be further added that if our present shell was actually
intended by his Malleus Normalis, the defects of his shell has
necessarily influenced his specific character and rendered it imperfect.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have not adverted to Malleus Anatinus of Chemnitz,
because the figure of that shell is ambiguous. There is a remote
resemblance in the lateral appendages of the beaks, but in other
particulars the resemblance is less obvious, the body is sometimes
curved as in the shell before us and sometimes straight, but the
edges of the valves are parallel, and the shell itself pellucid: the
figure in Chemnitz is less than half the size of our shell. This inhabits
the seas of Timor and the Nicobar Islands.</p>

<p class='c006'>It should be observed in conclusion that there is a specimen of
our species among the Hammer Shells in the British Museum, the
<i>habitat</i> of which is indicated by the word “Amboina:” it is much
smaller than our shell. Besides this we have lately seen another
example from New Holland, of a growth still larger than the shell
we have delineated.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have entered thus minutely into the analogies of this shell
from an apprehension we might otherwise in this instance submit as
a new species an object that had been previously described. The
result of our enquiry will tend to shew that if the species has not
remained entirely unnoticed, it has never been described with much
precision.</p>

<p class='c006'>The tribe of Butterflies to which the Papilio now before us
appertains, includes many of the larger and more interesting species
of the Papiliones known. This tribe, as its designation implies, has
been dedicated by Entomologists to the memory of the more distinguished
worthies of the Trojan race, and above others to preserve
the memory of those heroes whose exploits in the defence of that rich
and potent station of the ancient world, the town of Troy, has been
commemorated in the Iliad by the immortal Homer. Our present
species refers indeed to a Trojan of an earlier period; it is named
after Tros, the founder of the Trojan name. Tros was the fifth
king of the Trojan dynasty, from its first establishment in the person
of Scamander, and the last but three; the destruction of Troy being
accomplished under the reign of Priam. The country before the
time of Tros was called Dardania, from Dardanus, who is usually
stiled the first of the Trojan kings, though in Phrygia he was
preceded by Scamander and Teucer. Tros lived about fourteen
hundred years before the Christian Era, and reigned king of Troy
for the space of sixty years. It is in honour of this Trojan Monarch
that Fabricius has given the present insect the name of Papilio Tros.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are several Papiliones which bear a nearer or more distant
resemblance to this Papilio, a circumstance that will impose some
caution upon the Entomologist before he can venture to pronounce
upon the species with decision: its characters are nevertheless sufficiently
conspicuous, and when examined with due attention, enables
us to determine the species from its nearest approximations, in a
clear and satisfactory manner. The wings are dark above as well as
beneath, the deeper colouring prevailing, however, on the upper
surface as well as beneath; the anterior wings are marked with a
broad abbreviated whitish band, and the lower wings with a large
sanguineous or blood red spot of considerable magnitude. This
sanguineous spot from lying in the disk of the wing is traversed and
divided by the black nerves of the wing in such a manner as to
appear in the form of six distinct oblong spots, placed laterally to
each other: these spots appear also on the lower surface, in the same
form as above, but the colour is rather paler.</p>

<p class='c006'>As there is no figure extant of this large and fine Papilio in the
work of any author, the delineation which we have the pleasure on
this occasion to submit before our readers will doubtlessly be viewed
with peculiar satisfaction. It need be only added that the species
has been definitively determined upon the authority of Mr. Jones’s
collection of original drawings, to which Fabricius so constantly
refers, and that for this reason its specific appellation may be
implicitly upon by the scientific Entomologist.</p>

<p class='c006'>This interesting Papilio is a native of Brazil.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are few beings of the feathered race more peculiarly
distinguished for the splendid gaiety and rich variety of colours with
which their plumage is adorned than the parrot race; for however
they may differ in size from the magnitude of a kite or hawk, to that
of the comparative diminutive thrush or sparrow, they are almost
uniformly beautiful in this particular, and exhibit a diversity that is
scarcely found in any other tribe. The species we have selected for
our present representation is one of the smaller kinds of the family
distinguished by the name of Parrakeets. Its total length is about
six inches, its form robust or bulky in proportion.</p>

<p class='c006'>The bill and legs of this bird are usually described as being
dusky, in our specimen the bill is rather pale, tinged with brown
and greenish, and the legs inclining to flesh colour. The general
colour of the head and neck is green, and the same colour prevails
on the breast, belly, and thighs. Upon the crown of the head the
green assumes a blueish tint, and on the neck appears enlivened with
yellowish, the disk of a number of the feathers being of a yellow
colour, with the edges brown, so as to present a kind of scolloped
appearance. The back and wing coverts are deep black, with a
somewhat velvet aspect; the greater quill feathers black. But one
of the characters by which it is distinguished chiefly is the remarkable
band of yellow, and its contiguous parallel band of blue by
which the wings are traversed. This conspicuous band is formed
by the secondary quill feathers, which being of a fine yellow, with the
ends a lively blue, appear like two distinct bands, and from their
gaiety of colouring are admirably relieved by the deep sable hues of
the wings and back. In the bird before us the black colour of the
back extends nearly to the tail, the ends of the tail coverts only being
green. The most singular contrast in the appearance of its plumage
arises from the very different colour of the tail: this is of a pale
carnation, glossed or changeable to a delicate violet. The tail, with
the exception of the two middle feathers, is traversed near the tip
with a single broad band of black; the two middle feathers are of the
same pale carnation colour as the rest, but rather more inclined
to blueish.</p>

<p class='c006'>The black winged Parrot is described as a native of Batavia
and Luzonia. Our specimen we are assured is from the Brazils. We
have also very lately had an opportunity of consulting an extensive
series of drawings, representing the principal Natural productions
of Surinam, made by an Englishman resident upon the spot, for
his own amusement, and among those drawings have met with one
of the black winged Parrakeet. Upon this authority we have no
hesitation in pronouncing it to be a native of Surinam; and indeed it
seems to be so well known in that part of the world that it is distinguished
among the inhabitants by a peculiar name, it is called by
them <i>Ajàlàlero</i>.</p>

<p class='c019'><cite>Jon. pict. n. 149.</cite></p>

<hr class='c014' />
<p class='c006'>The Papiliones of the <i>Heliconii</i> tribe are named by Linnæus
after the nymphs of the fabulous and mythological history of the
ancient classics; an example that has been followed by Fabricius,
and subsequently by other writers. Thus the present interesting
insect is dedicated to commemorate among the votaries of science,
the name of Hippodamia, a nymph feigned by the poets to be
the daughter of Oenomaiis, and who according to the legends of
classic lore, besides being much celebrated for her beauty, was distinguished
for her swiftness in the race; and at length bestowed her
fair hand in marriage upon Pelops, because in speed he excelled her.</p>

<p class='c006'>This insect, which is of a moderate size, is of a light and elegant
structure. The wings are black, but the transparent spots occupy
so much space that the sable colouring does not appear predominant;
it is less prevalent in the posterior than the anterior wings, and yet
less upon the under surface than the upper. The form and disposition
of these transparent spots with which the dark colour of this fly
is variegated, are altogether characteristic, and deserve particular
attention, because there are other insects of the same tribe which
pretty nearly resemble it. From the middle of the anterior wing
extends a transparent spot of a very elongated heart shaped form,
having the point directed to the thorax, and a bar of black crossing
it at the broader end, so as to give it the appearance of two distinct
spots; and beyond this is another hyaline spot about the same size as
the larger one of the two transparent spaces of which the first-mentioned
spot consists. The posterior part of the wing is further
marked with two bands of the same transparent texture as the others,
each consisting of three distinct spots. The lower wings present a
larger transparent space than the upper wings, the whole disk being
hyaline with only the posterior limb or border opake, and of a black
colour. The thorax and body is black.</p>

<p class='c006'>The hyaline spots as seen on the under side are of the same size
and form as they appear above, but the opake spaces instead of being
uniformly black as on the upper surface, are agreeably diversified
with rufous and geminous dots of white: these double white dots
are situated on the black border at the tips of the wings, three on
that of the anterior pair, and three on that of the posterior ones.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the very close analogy that prevails between this and
several other species of the same tribe, it would, no doubt, have been
a matter of considerable difficulty at this time to determine the
Fabrician species Papilio Hippodamia with precision, if we had not
possessed the means of reference to the Fabrician manuscripts, and the
drawings in which it is delineated; for it has remained to this period
unfigured by any author. It will be observed that Fabricius does
not refer for this species to the Collectanea of Mr. Jones, as in many
other instances. The cause of this omission will admit of a very
easy explanation; Fabricius had seen the insect in the first instance
in the cabinet of M. Mauduit, at Paris, to which he has referred.
But subsequently when in England he found a drawing of the insect
in the collection of Mr. Jones, and inscribed the name and character
of the species upon the drawing, as it afterwards appeared in his
Entomologia Systematica; and it is upon this authority that we are
enabled to speak with certainty upon a species which, but for this
circumstance, would be now involved in ambiguity. The figures in
our plate are copied from the drawings of Mr. Jones, inscribed with
the hand-writing of Fabricius.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the time Fabricius described this species its <i>habitat</i> was
unknown: we have lately met with it in a collection of Brasilian
insects, and entertain no doubt of its having been brought with the
rest from that part of the globe.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c006'>Every Conchologist is aware of the existence of this superb shell:
its magnitude is considerable, and its colour too conspicuously distinct
from that of all other species of its genus to be passed over without
immediate observation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Cypræa generally are a tribe of shells peculiarly striking:
the most common species possess an elegance of fervid colouring and
politure that never fail to recommend them to attention. But a
few years only have passed away, since the mantle decorations of the
fire place in the apartments of fashion, besides images and jars of
china porcellain, consisted of shells, among which the various kinds
of Cowries were not esteemed the least ornamental. And they are
sometimes still seen in such situations; while the grotesque statuary,
the josses, and the dragons, of China and Japan, in conformity with
a better taste, have wholly disappeared.</p>

<p class='c006'>The shells of the Cypræa, genus which are most familiar to the
generality of observers, are the spotted Cowries, and some others of
usual occurrence. There are others which from their rarity are less
extensively known, and among the number we may truly rank the
species which we have now before us, the Orange Cowry, or as it is
sometimes called, the “Morning Dawn.” The beauty of this shell, as
well as scarcity, has established its celebrity; the species is well known,
but few collections, excepting those of the more costly kind, possess
the shell. Its magnitude is considerable, for its size is nothing inferior
to that of the Spotted Cowry, which ranks in this respect the chief
species of its family, while the distinction of its colour from that of all
other shells of the Cypræa tribe at once attracts particular attention.</p>

<p class='c006'>The colour of the back in this species is of a very fine orange,
simple, and unadorned with any marks or spots whatever. The tint
of orange varies in different shells from pale to darker, but whatever
may be its deviations in this respect, the tint of colour is constantly
deepest upon the back, and the transition as constantly becoming
gradually paler or more diluted as the colour descends upon the sides
towards the margin. This margin is rounded, projecting, and of a
pure white, except at the throat, as it is termed, where a tint of
red or reddish prevails to a small extent. The under surface of the
shell is white, except at the sides where the orange colour of the back
descends, spreads, and fades away into the white. The aperture of
the shell is a longitudinal opening down the middle as usual in the
other kinds of Cowry; the surrounding region of the shell is a pure
white, but the edges of the opening, both which are beset with
numerous linear teeth, are of a fine orange.</p>

<p class='c006'>For the discovery of this extremely beautiful shell, like many
other acquisitions of importance in the cabinet of the Conchologist,
we stand indebted to the assiduities of that eminent Naturalist
Sir Joseph Banks, and those who accompanied him in the celebrated
voyage of Captain Cook round the world. They observed it among
the ornaments with which the natives of Otaheite had decorated their
dresses, which were composed of feathers, and the barks of trees.
To these garments they were attached by means of a string passing
through a hole perforated for the purpose on one side of the shell.
The natives were not so easily induced to part with these shells as
the other decorations of their clothing, appreciating them at a much
higher value. Our navigators were at first led to imagine these shells
to be inhabitants of the seas surrounding Otaheite, in which particular
they were at length undeceived by the natives who informed them to
the contrary: they said the shells were found near an island at a
great distance from Otaheite, and from the direction of the spot
toward which they pointed, it was conjectured they meant the Fegee
or Fidgi Islands, which are inhabited by the most ferocious cannibals
throughout those seas.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c015'><sup>[24]</sup></a> Our navigators were therefore able only to
procure such specimens as were attached to the dresses of the natives,
and these being almost constantly perforated for the better convenience
of fastening them on safely, at once explains the reason of the Orange
Cowry being so rarely met with undisfigured by such perforation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The mention of this circumstance, which at this distant period
can be little known, is moreover of some importance, because as
the shells were really brought from Otaheite, it has been generally
supposed to be a native of that island, and has even sometimes been
called the Otaheitan Cowry. Gmelin, who records this shell under the
name of Cypræa Aurantium, speaks of it as a native of the Friendly
Isles, “habitat ad insulas amicas,” resting his authority, we apprehend,
upon the Conchology of Martyn, and which though published
shortly after the return of Captain Cook, could not be so well informed
upon the subject as the venerable friend who assured us it is neither
a native of Otaheite, nor the Friendly Islands. Lamarck has subsequently
observed that the species inhabits the seas of the Friendly
Islands as well as those of Otaheite, and also of New Zealand. Upon
what authority the <em>localities</em> have been increased to this extent is not
stated. We have understood from very good authority that researches
have been made repeatedly of late years by our navigators to discover
the shells in those seas, and without effect; and this fact appears to
be confirmed from the increasing value and importance attached to
the species. We are indeed not entirely certain that any of these
shells have ever been procured, except as before observed from among
the natives of Otaheite, and the value of the shell has progressively
advanced in consequence from four, or five, to ten pounds. A specimen
in the collection of Mrs. Angus sold about three years ago in London
for twenty guineas; thirty guineas have been in vain offered for
another specimen within the last two or three years, and a collector
at this period in London is in possession of another which it is understood
cost him very lately fifty guineas. These circumstances, if we
mistake not, conspire to prove, that the Orange Cowry is a far more
local species than might be inferred from the observation of Lamarck.</p>

<p class='c006'>Besides the name of Otaheitan Cowry, this shell has been also
called the “Orange Cowry,” and the “Morning Dawn,” in reference
to the latin “Cypræa Aurantium,” and “Aurora,” by both which it
had been at different times distinguished. That of Aurantium alludes
only to the prevailing orange colour of the shell, and has been given
to it by Gmelin after Martyn. There is something more poetically
elegant, and perhaps no less appropriate in the trivial name Aurora,
which Lamarck adopts: we may in truth compare its beauteous
fulvous hues fading into white with inexpressive softness, to the
warm glowing tints and fainter blushes of an opening morning sky
in summer. We have also adopted this name as well as Lamarck,
for its peculiar elegance, in preference to that of Aurantium.</p>

<p class='c006'>The origin of the epithet “Aurora,” bestowed upon this shell
has probably long since been forgotten; it arose from one of those
fugitive events not likely to be recorded excepting only in the recollection
of collectors; and those in whose immediate knowledge the
circumstance occurred have long since passed this transitory scene
and are perhaps ere this themselves forgotten. The relation though
in some respects trivial, may afford amusement to the amateur: it
serves to shew the origin of its name “Aurora” at the same time that
it presents a striking illustration of that ardent zeal with which the
science of Conchology was cultivated in this country nearly half a
century ago; its authenticity may be relied upon. The circumstance
as related to us by an old collector some years ago was briefly
this; a specimen of the shell had very shortly after the return of the
discovery ships been presented by one of the officers to a lady, which
coming to the knowledge of a most zealous collector of that period,
he solicited the indulgence of seeing it; and waited upon the lady for
the purpose, upon an intimation that the favour would be readily
granted. Madam, said the enraptured visitor, gazing in admiration
upon the Cowry, which he now beheld for the first time, has
this shell a price? will twenty guineas purchase this lovely gem? it
will not answered the lady. Allow me then said its enthusiastic
admirer to clasp it for a moment in my hands, and bending on one
knee, at the same time pressing the shell to his lips, pronounced with
an emphasis of poetic fervour, “thus do I salute the ‘Morning Dawn’
of the new discovered world!” Let poets reverence Venus the beauty
of the Grecian seas: my idol is “Aurora,” this sea-born nymph of
surpassing beauty, that rose upon the waves of the Southern deep!</p>

<p class='c006'>Abating somewhat of the romantic warmth with which the ideas
of the venerable collector alluded to was expressed, it must be admitted
that in point of beautiful simplicity this shell has never been surpassed
by any subsequent discoveries in the southern hemisphere; and it is
no less singular than certain that the price of twenty guineas, which
that collector named upon an imaginary valuation, has become the
average standard value of a fine shell of this kind for some years past.
At present they are more highly prized, because it is now pretty
clearly ascertained that they are no longer to be procured among the
natives of Otaheite; and for this reason it is much more likely they
will reach a still higher price than that the value of them should
diminish. The shell we have represented is to be considered as a very
fine specimen in respect to size as well as colour.</p>

<p class='c006'>A very rare species of the Parrakeet tribe, and which is presumed
to be a native of South America.</p>

<p class='c006'>The length of this bird is nine inches and a half; the bill and
legs blackish. The prevailing colour of the plumage green, front and
crown of the head blueish green, the rest of the head and neck black:
the feathers upon the face glossed with blue: a large ovate cinereous
spot on the cheeks: throat and breast black varied with pale yellowish
scollops, the margin of the feathers being a pale sulphureous yellow,
the disk black: the black disk usually forming a kind of triangular
spot with the point tending downwards. The wings are green, except
the quill feathers, which are blue, and the butt of the wing or
shoulder the colour of which is scarlet. The body beneath green
with a large spot of sanguineous-purple on the abdomen. The lower
part of the back and rump the same sanguineous purple colour as
the abdominal spot: tail above green, the feathers purplish towards
the end; beneath rufous brown.</p>

<p class='c006'>This curious bird is nearly allied to <i>Psittacus Squammosus</i>, the
<i>Scaly Breasted Parrakeet</i>, and in no very remote degree with another
kind of Parrakeet, the <i>Wavy Breasted Parrot</i>, <i>Psittacus Lineatus</i>.
The first of these our bird exceeds by at least an inch in length, the
other by an inch and a quarter. Instead of the dark colours of
the head, as in our bird, the head and neck of P. Squammosus are
dull orange. The darker colouring of our bird assimilates more
nearly with <i>Psittacus Lineatus</i>, but in other respects is entirely
different. We have considered it as a new species, at the same time
that it must be observed from the very close analogy that prevails
between this bird and the Scaly Breasted Parrakeet, it may possibly
prove hereafter to be the adult bird of that kind rather than a
distinct species.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c006'>This is one among the number of those very choice accessions
to the Conchological knowledge of the last century, that was derived
from the scientific labours of our first circumnavigators in the Southern
Ocean: it occurred to them upon the coast of New Zealand, not in
any abundance, but so far plentifully that after the Banksian Cabinet
was supplied there were several specimens to spare for distribution
among the friends of Sir Joseph Banks, Dr. Solander, and Captain
Cook. From this little store the species passed in the first instance
into several collections, and among others into that of the late Duchess
of Portland, Dr. Chauncey, Mr. Cracherode, Mr. G. Humphrey, and
some others. It has since occurred, but not in any abundance to
later voyagers in those seas. And it is reputed also to have been
met with in the Straits of Magellan.</p>

<p class='c006'>The specimen of this rare shell which we have delineated, and
which always was considered as one of the largest of its species known,
once constituted part of the Testaceological collection of Sir Ashton
Lever, having been presented to that eminent collector by Captain
Cook, at the time of his return to England after his first voyage.
There is a small hole pierced through the upper valve of this shell,
and which, in the absence of all other information, induces the
persuasion of its having been originally suspended like several other
shells we have already mentioned, as an ornament or appendage to
the dress of some New Zealander; the aperture being so designed
that the two valves could easily have been kept together by means of
a string passing through this hole of the upper valve, and the opening
in the beak of the lower one. The animal inhabitant is probably
eaten by the New Zealanders, who besides being cannibals, subsist
chiefly upon the marine productions of their shores, which their
wives and female children obtain daily for them by swimming and
diving into the sea. There is a rare species found in the Mediterranean
Sea, Anomia Vitrea of Gmelin, which nearly approaches this species
in point of size, and is eagerly sought after, we are told, by the
people of those parts as a delicious food. We should, however,
imagine from its scarcity, that it is only at the tables of the rich that
this luxurious repast appears.</p>

<p class='c006'>In adopting the genus Terebratula for the shell before us, some
explanation may be expected for our departure from the Linnæan
classification, for in the system of that author it is one of the Anomia
Tribe, the term and character of Terebratula not being recognised
by that author as generically distinct from the Anomia. Our reasons
for this deviation shall be explained as briefly as it is possible: from
the nature of those remarks, and the extent of enquiry with which it
is connected, this cannot however be comprised within very slender
limits.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the Linnæan arrangement, the Anomia form a very comprehensive
genus, and since in particular the fossil species are included
it should certainly have been divided into several distinct sections or
families in order to embrace the different tribes of those shells, which
according to the character Linnæus has given of the genus must
necessarily be referred to it. It is impossible without some modification
of this kind to reconcile <i>Anomia Ephippium and Cepa</i>, with
<i>Anomia Caput Serpentinus</i> or <i>Terebratula</i>, or either of them with
<i>A. Placenta</i>; and there are besides these some other families which
do not well accord, and which might perhaps be separated into
distinct genera with great advantage, the fossil kinds especially, which
are very numerous and much diversified in structure. It cannot be
very material whether they be so divided into genera or be placed in
different families under the general appellation of Anomiæ: they are
obviously very dissimilar and should be kept apart, and we have
examples of both these modes of classing the Anomiæ among the
early Naturalists.</p>

<p class='c006'>A late french writer, M. Bosc, speaking of this tribe of shells,
observes, that Linnæus having confounded the <i>Terebratules</i> with the
<i>Anomies</i>, Bruguière first established their differences, and Lamarck
had fixed their characters. This observation is not sufficiently
explicit, and may possibly imply more than the author of it has
intended. It assumes as a conclusion that Linnæus committed
an error in confounding these two genera, without informing us in
what state of arrangement Linnæus found them. It may be inferred
from this that they had been more accurately discriminated before
his time, or on the contrary, that they never had been classed in any
form, and that it was the want of knowledge in Linnæus which led
him to confound shells together that were generically distinct. But
whichever we are to understand, the conclusion is, that Linnæus had
confounded them, and that it remained for Bruguière and Lamarck
to reform those errors of Linnæus, which all later Naturalists had
left uncorrected, if not unobserved. Now really this view of the
subject is not fairly taken if such an inference be intended. The
result of a very little enquiry among the authors who preceded
Linnæus, or were immediately subsequent to him, will assure us of
the truth of this; and will convince us beyond a doubt, that the
discrimination of neither of those authors was necessary either to
furnish the Naturalists of the present day with the term Terebratula;
to determine the differences that exist between them and the Anomiæ,
or to fix the characters by which the Terebratulæ are distinguished.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Anomia genus, instead of being devised by Linnæus, or
Terebratula in particular, owing its invention to any modern writer,
have been both so long established that the greatest difficulty is to
determine where in the retrospect of authors our enquiries are to
cease. Without proceeding further back than the last two centuries,
it may be observed that <i>Fabius Columna</i> in his work “De Purpura,”
published at Rome in the year 1616, speaks of the Anomiæ; he calls
them <i>Conchæ rariores Anomiæ</i>, and from that period at least the
term Anomia has been received among Naturalists. Nor is the term
Terebratula of much later origin. Da Costa in his Elements of
Conchology informs us that from the time of Fabius Columna the
word Anomia had become universal, that is as a general denomination
for all the shells which Linnæus subsequently placed together
under that name. The term Terebratula was given, says this writer,
by Gualtieri; in plate 96 of his work, Gualtieri figures three recent
kinds, and has made a particular genus for them, which he calls
Terebratula. And it is further added in another place “the Anomiæ
are bivalves with unequal valves, and never eared, the beak of the
largest or under valve is greatly produced, and rises or curves over
the beak of the smaller or upper valve, and is perforated or pierced
through like a tube, from which particular they have also obtained
the name of <i>Terebratulæ</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>These remarks sufficiently establish the circumstance of the term
Anomia, being a comprehensive title for all the shells which Linnæus
subsequently placed together under that name, and also shews that
we are not indebted to either Bruguière or Lamarck for discriminating
the Terebratulæ. We can ever go further back in this particular
than Da Costa has done, for that able author is mistaken in supposing
Gualtieri to be the first writer who had proposed the genus Terebratula.
Gualtieri published his work in the year 1724, and we
happen to possess among other valuable MSS. of the celebrated
Antiquarian, Hearne, the original copy of Lluid’s Lithophylacia
Britannica, as corrected for the press, dated Montgomery, 1698, in
which the genus Terebratula is distinctly named: and this, as it
appears from the date, was more than fifty years before the time of
Gualtieri; and we have also the authority of our english Lister in
1694 for the like distinction. All these writers, it will be observed,
preceded Klein, who has in a particular manner described the genus
Terebratula in his Methodus Ostraceologia, published in 1753, but
in which he does not speak of himself as having invented that term.
“<span class='sc'>Terebratulas</span>, <i>Luidiano</i> titulo, vocamus <span class='sc'>Diaconchas</span> anomalas,
rostro parterebrato, vid. <i>Nomencl. Litholog. Promotum</i> hoc
titulo.” His genus <i>Concha</i> <span class='fss'>ΤΡΊΛΟΒΟΣ</span>, genus <i>Concha</i> <span class='sc'>Adunca</span>, genus
<span class='sc'>Bursula</span>, and genus <span class='sc'>Globus</span>, are all sub-divisions of the <i>Anomiæ
Conchæ</i> of other writers, divided according to their forms and other
peculiarities, and in which particular attention is paid to the perforation
or non-perforation of the beak; Trilobos being distinguished as
“<i>vertice integro</i>,” Bursula as <i>Terebratulæformes</i> rostro non perforato,
&amp;c. And we may lastly mention that from some original MSS. of
Da Costa, in our possession, it appears that Anomia was a general term
for the whole family, and <i>Terebratula Anomiæ lævis</i> was the term by
which the English and other Naturalists, long prior to the middle of
last century, were accustomed to distinguish the same kind of shells
which in the modern nomenclature of Conchology is also named
generically Terebratula. Da Costa, as Librarian of the Royal Society,
was in the habit of correspondence with the learned men of his time
throughout Europe, and his local knowledge from this circumstance,
though never committed to the press, is not likely to be disputed.</p>

<p class='c006'>We could proceed yet further, but enough has surely been
advanced to shew that so far from Linnæus having confounded the
Terebratula with the Anomia, he left them precisely as he found
them, placing them after the example of his predecessors, under the
comprehensive term of Anomia, which they had assigned to them.
And we have also said enough to prove that to ascribe the Genus
Terebratula to either Bruguière or Lamarck can result only from our
ignorance of that information which in former days was regarded as
the best criterion of an able Naturalist, a correct knowledge of the
labours of his predecessors.</p>

<p class='c006'>Under all its circumstances it may be a matter of some indifference
to the scientific Naturalist whether in the arrangement of the
Anomiæ we follow the concise method of the old writers and Linnæus
among the number, or the diffuse distribution of later writers. If we
place them in different families according to their characters, whether
regarded as sectional distinctions of Anomia, or as distinct genera,
we shall at least produce some consistency in the arrangement. But
there is yet another mode of arrangement which appears to be the
favourite theme with some Conchologists of the present day, and
which it may be proper in this place to mention, namely, the classification
of shells according to their animals. This has been attempted
in the work of Cuvier, his “Règne Animal,” and the result of this
endeavour, so far as it relates to the Anomia in particular, may in this
place deserve our explicit observation. In this work (<cite>Règne Animal</cite>)
Cuvier endeavouring to class the Anomiæ according to the animals
known to inhabit them, as well as those which he imagines for the fossil
tribes, so disperses them, that the Trochi, Turbines, Nautili, Volutæ,
and indeed nearly the whole of the <i>Univalves</i> intervene between his
two first genera of these <i>bivalves</i>, Hyalæa and Anomia; and the
Anomia tridentata of Forskahl, which is the Hyalæa of this author, is
placed with Clio (the shell of which is our <i>Bulla Aperta</i><a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c015'><sup>[26]</sup></a>) among the
<i>Ptéropodes</i>. After the long interval occasioned by this introduction of
the Univalves we find Anomia,<a href='#f26' class='c015'><sup>[26]</sup></a> and Placuna, two of his genera together,
but with another tribe of beings, the animal inhabitants being of
his class <i>Acéphales</i>; and after another wide interval in which the
bivalve Mya,<a href='#f26' class='c015'><sup>[26]</sup></a> the multivalve Pholas,<a href='#f26' class='c015'><sup>[26]</sup></a> the univalve Teredo,<a href='#f26' class='c015'><sup>[26]</sup></a> and the
naked or shell-less Ascidia, occur we find in a distant class among another
tribe of animals, <i>Mollusques Brachopodes</i>, the genus <i>Terebratula</i>.
It is here ascribed to Bruguière, as in other works it is assigned
to Lamarck. Such is the arrangement of this family in the <i>Règne
Animal</i> of Cuvier, a form in which no cabinet, it must be acknowledged,
could be arranged without embracing the most unprecedented
anomalies; nor can we doubt that if the animals of the fossil Terebratulæ
and Anomiæ were known, for in this arrangement they rest
on presumption only, they must be further separated in such a
system than they are at present, some being perforated at the beaks,
others imperforate, and some having the aperture under the beaks,
all which demonstrates a difference in the structure of the animal, to
whose use they were adapted.</p>

<p class='c006'>From this analysis of the generical distinctions of the different
families of the Anomiæ we may now be permitted to return to the
shell before us, the object of our more immediate consideration, and
respecting which there appears to be no less misconception among late
later writers than we have found already respecting the genera.</p>

<p class='c006'>It appears that Dr. Leach had some short time since published
a figure of this shell: his definition is altogether brief, and the information
he affords less explanatory than might be desired: he quotes
no authority or synonyms, and in his general description merely
observes that “It seems to be a very rare species, a few specimens
only having been received from New Zealand.” <cite>Vide. Zool. Misc. p. 76.</cite>
Lamarck assuming from these observations, as it may be presumed,
that the shell had not been previously noticed, unless it were an Anomia
Capensis of Gmelin, proposes it as a new species under the name
of Terebratula Sanguinea of Leach, at the same time that he rejects
his specific character, and assigns another to the species; the character
given to it as a new species by Dr. Leach is “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Testa sanguinea,
subtillissime et creberrime impresso-punctata, longitudinaliter costata,
costis simplicibus; antica uniundulata</i></span>;” that of Lamarck,
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Testâ oblongâ, irregulari, rubrá, creberrimé impresso punctata;
striis transversis undulatîs; margine denticulato</i></span>,” to which is added,
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Habite—les mers de la Nouvelle Zélande d’après M. Leach</i></span>.”
This seems to shew that the shell was only known to Lamarck,
through the communication of the last-mentioned writer; and the
suggestion is the more probable since the specimen in the British
Museum has the same interrogation as to being the Anomia Capensis
of Chemnitz, that is annexed by Lamarck to his description of the
species. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je crois qu’on doit donner comme synonyme l’Anomia
capensis Gmel., d’après la citation de Chemniz; mais l’individu que
j’avais sous les yeux, n’est pas assez entier pour affirmer ce rapprochement.</span>”</p>

<p class='c006'>There is obviously some want of farther explanation in these
details, the omission of which may possibly be supplied by tracing
the history of this interesting shell from the time in which it first
appeared in this country; for there are local circumstances connected
with it which having escaped the mention of Dr. Leach, and consequently
of Lamarck, have led to the erroneous conclusion that it had
remained till very lately undescribed. Dr. Leach was probably not
aware, or through some oversight omits to notice that the specific
name which he has given to this shell was that assigned to it many
years ago by Dr. Solander, and that it has uniformly borne the name
of <i>Anomia sanguinea</i>, or (<i>Terebratula sanguinea</i>) among all the
English Naturalists in consequence from the time of that learned
friend and companion of Sir Joseph Banks down to the present
period: It is the Anomia sanguinea of Dr. Solanders MSS. and was
designated under that name in the Museum of the Dutchess of
Portland: it appeared under the same appellation in the catalogue of
that museum, published in 1786: in the Calonnian Museum and
Catalogue, printed in the year 1795; it stood under that name also
in the Museum of Sir Ashton Lever, and it appeared under the same
denomination in the sale catalogue of that museum, published in the
year 1806. Under all these circumstances it may be presumed the
name must have obtained no small publicity, and we need scarcely
add that the example of these authorities were followed in the Cabinets
of english collectors generally, that happened to be in possession
of the shell, among which was that of Mr. Cracherode, which was
subsequently deposited in the British Museum. And lastly, it should
be mentioned that it occurs under the same name in the Testaceological
Manual of Mr. Dillwyn. Nothing therefore can be more certain than
that the french writers are not correct in their opinion when they
imagine that the shell had been so named in the first instance by
Dr. Leach; and it is no less certain that the credit of having first
noticed the species is due to Dr. Solander, he described it more than
forty years ago: his words as they stand in his manuscripts are,
“<span class='sc'>Anomia sanguinea</span> <i>obovato, longitudinaliter sulcata, triloba;
sinu profundo nate producta latere angulata foramen ambiente</i>.”
Mr. Dillwyn has well expressed the character of this shell in his
description of Anomia Sanguinea, but has by some oversight misquoted
this passage of Dr. Solander’s manuscripts; and by that means has
confounded the <i>Anomia Sanguinea</i> of Dr. Solander, with his Anomia
Cruenta; this will be more fully shewn hereafter.</p>

<p class='c006'>Upon this subject we have only lastly to observe that although
Lamarck has deemed it requisite to give a specific character of this
shell dissimilar from that of Dr. Leach, he omits to mention, as well
as the former, that very conspicuous character of the species, the
deep longitudinal hollow down the middle of the upper valve, and
the dorsal elevation of the lower one. Lamarck, indeed, confesses
that the individual which he had under his eyes, and consequently
that which he describes, is not sufficiently perfect to authorize him
in determining the analogy between that shell and the Anomia
Capensis of Gmelin, which Chemnitz has figured; a circumstance
that may explain the cause of this omission in the specific character
of Terebratula sanguinea. Yet we should have thought a shell
sufficiently entire to have enabled this ingenious Naturalist to have
composed his character of the species, would have been so far perfect
as to have justified some conclusion upon its analogy with the
Gmelinian Anomia Capensis. We may confidently add that these
two shells are totally distinct species, and are even generically different
if we enter very scrupulously upon their distinctive characters.
Dr. Solander had described this latter shell before the time of Gmelin
under the name of Anomia Cruenta.</p>

<p class='c006'>The representations of this choice testaceous production, which
accompanies our present description, will, it is presumed, convey a
more correct idea of the shell than can be expressed by words. The
Leverian specimen from which, as before observed, these figures are
taken, realized at the public hammer at the Leverian sale the sum of
five guineas,<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c015'><sup>[27]</sup></a> and it still remains so rare that there would probably
be little, if any, dimunition in the price were it again to be disposed
of in the same manner at the present period. The shells of this kind
vary in some small degree in the intensity of colour from a very deep
sanguineous red to a paler hue.</p>

from which the drawing was taken. It is from this individual
example in the cabinet of Mr. Jones that the delineation in the
annexed plate is copied.</p>

<p class='c006'>This curious Papilio is one of the larger species of the Heliconi
tribe to which it appertains. The wings are a blueish black, and
rather closely studded with sub-hyaline or transparent spots, which
are minutely speckled with black: those on the anterior wings are
somewhat sagittate and disposed into two irregular bands towards the
exterior half of the wings: those on the posterior wings are rather
larger and more inclining to an ovate form; and three of the largest,
namely, one at the base, and two at the anal angle, are of a bright
yellow colour. The inner limb of the wing is grey inclining to
yellowish. The head and thorax are black; the abdomen black with
the sides pale yellow. The spots being semitransparent the appearance
on the underside in a great degree corresponds with that above:
there is a small difference, because instead of one yellowish spot at
the base of the posterior wing, there are two, another smaller than
that which appears at the base of that wing on the upper surface
being situated below it. We have been more minute in the description
of these spots, because upon an attentive comparison of the insect
in Mr. Jones’s Cabinet, with the Fabrician description, we perceive
some small deficiency in the latter, a circumstance, it must be confessed,
of rare occurrence in this author, but unquestionably worthy
of our notice and correction, as it is the only authority upon which
the species must in future rest.</p>

<p class='c006'>The country of this interesting insect is unknown; it is remotely
conjectured only that it may be Africa. The insect is represented

<p class='c006'>In the arrangement of Cuvier, entitled “<cite>Règne Animal</cite>,” the
Mollusca or animal of the Nerita constitutes one of his “<i>Gasteropodes
pectinibranches</i>,” the character of which as defined by that author is
quite as comprehensive and rather less explicit than the Linnæan
limaces: he divides them into several families according to the peculiar
form of their shells, for collectively almost every genera of the
spiral univalves fall under this very general denomination, as well as
many of those shells which are simply conic, as in the Linnæan
classification they do under that of Limax. Cuvier mentions as a
character of this tribe that their breathing apertures, with the exception
of a family he calls Cyclostomes, are composed of a number of
foliations ranged parallel to each other like the teeth of a comb.
They have two feelers, and two eyes usually situated on a pedicle.
The greatest difference between these animals consist in the presence
or absence of the canal formed by a prolongation of the edge of the
pulmonary cavity of the left side, a respiratory organ communicating
with others by means of which the animal breathes without quitting
its retreat in the water.</p>

<p class='c006'>According to Lamarck the animal of Nerita has the foot large
and short, with two pointed feelers, and the eyes raised upon a
papilla at the exterior base of each.</p>

<p class='c006'>Bosc is less diffuse than either. The animal of the Nerites, he
observes, have the head flat and lunate, a little sloping to the two
extremities: from the base of the head on each side issues two conic
slender horns, one of which is twice the length of the other. The
eyes are two little black points placed upon a trihedral tubercule at
the exterior base of the horns, the mouth placed underneath the head
and formed with a lip, thick and wrinkled. The foot almost round,
flat beneath, convex above, and rather shorter than the shell. The
mantle or fleshy prolongation entirely covers the interior of the shell
and is slightly crenulated at the margin.</p>

<p class='c006'>Denys de Montfort speaking of the species Nerita Peloronata, a
shell abounding on the shores of the Antilles, observes that there are
male and female animals of this kind, the two sexes being isolated or
distinct individuals; they are of an amphibious nature, living in the
sea, from whence they ascend occasionally and crawl about the rocks.</p>

<p class='c006'>Linnæus under the Nerita genus comprehends as well the
imperforated or non-umbilicated kinds as those which have that
perforation. The later continental writers divide these again, retaining
the name Nerita to those which have no perforation; those with
a perforation are called Natica, by the french authors Natice, after
Adanson, Gualtieri, and Favanne. Lamarck has also a genus
Neritina, and another Navicella, all which in the Linnæan system are
of the Nerita tribe.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nerita Polita is by no means an uncommon shell upon the
coasts of the Indian Ocean, being found throughout their whole
extent from Japan to the Cape of Good of Hope, and as it appears
also upon the shores of many islands in the Indian and the Great
Southern Ocean.</p>

<p class='c006'>Besides being so very abundant in those parts, it may also be
observed that no species of the testaceous tribe is more remarkable
for the almost endless variety of colours, or the form and disposition
of the spots, dots, and lineations, than the individuals of this kind of
Nerit. There are, however, some few of its varieties which from
being local are far less abundant than the rest, and the shell in particular
which we have selected for the most conspicuous object in the
annexed plate is one the most important of the number. The prevailing
colour of the ordinary varieties is olivaceous, in some paler,
in others more inclining to blackish; the charactered marks in general
yellowish, triangular or sagittate, and varied with short blackish lines.
This is the usual appearance of the back or upper part of the shell,
the region surrounding the mouth is white, including the lip, the
inside of the mouth yellow, and this latter character appears constant
throughout all the varieties of the species. The particular variety
which constitutes the chief object in our plate, is of the red banded
kind, the bands being diversified with red and white, disposed in
spots, and lineations, with peculiar elegance. The varieties of this
banded kind are scarce in general, but the particular kind which we
have represented is unique, whether regarded for its magnitude, its
exquisite perfection, or brilliancy of colouring. We have represented
the upper and under surface of this shell, together with the upper
and under surface of a shell of the common kind, in order that by
the contrast, the beauty of the former might be exemplified with
greater perspicuity.</p>

<p class='c006'>The history of this matchless variety of Nerita Polita is distinctly
known: it is one of those shells which were brought from the
Sandwich Islands by Captain Cook, when he returned from his first
voyage of discovery in the South Seas. It was observed appended
to an ornament worn at the breast of one of the natives, and was
obtained in exchange, it is believed, for an iron hatchet; the Islander
to whom it belonged esteeming it very much, and the English Officer
being anxious to possess it. This circumstance of its having been
affixed to an ornament worn by one of the savages, explains the
reason of the shell being perforated, the hole having been made in
order to pass a string through the shell to fasten it on the ornament
securely. The shell was presented by Captain Cook to Sir Ashton
Lever, in whose Museum it was subsequently deposited; and
notwithstanding the defect above-mentioned, this little shell produced
at the dissolution of the Leverian Museum, in the year 1806, the
sum of nine pounds sterling, at the public hammer.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c015'><sup>[29]</sup></a> A celebrated
collector, the late Mr. Noel Jennings, was the purchaser; and it is
understood that on the subsequent dispersion of the collection of
Mr. Jennings, which took place a few years ago, that it became, with
some other very rare shells of that collection, the property of Lord
Mount Morris.</p>

shells, engraved and published by Bonanni, and also in the works of Lister
and some others, escaped the notice of Linnæus. So late as the tenth edition

it to be as might be naturally expected, “testa <i>costis</i> æqualibus;” for it is the ribs,
and not for veins that Linnæus intended. Linnæus refers to the 10th edition
of his Systema Naturæ, which is not mentioned by Gmelin, and here we again
meet with the same reading “testa <i>costis</i> æqualibus, &amp;c.” We have been the
more explicit in pointing out this error, because we observe that one Conchologist,
not long since, in the absence, doubtlessly, of the moment, has translated

<p class='c006'><a href='#r10'>10</a>. We have lately understood that the editors of <cite>Encyclopædie Methodique</cite>,
now publishing in Paris, intend giving figures of the Papiliones of the
Equites family, which Fabricius has described. This endeavour to illustrate
Fabricius is under the direction of Mons. Latreille, a Member of the
National Institute, an Entomologist himself, of acknowledged talent, and
one to whose great ability, as well as personal urbanity, we are happy to
bear our testimony of praise. In the absence of more conclusive authority,
the conjectures of Mons. Latreille would be, unquestionably, useful; but we
shall, ourselves, tread the same path, and as we trust, may assist also, in no
small degree to dispel the darkness which at present overshadows this fair
portion of the science. As we are, ourselves, possessed of the authentic
evidences, by means of which, the species of Fabricius can be immediately
identified, we have no occasion to wander into the labyrinths of conjecture:
we at once arrive at the certainty of truth. The annunciation of this design,
on the part of the French editors, leads to a conclusion of the importance
attached to this endeavour: it need be only stated on our part, that the
illustrations we shall subjoin to such of the Fabrician species as may pass
under our own observations, will be precisely taken from the individual
objects which Fabricius has described.</p>

<p class='c006'><a href='#r14'>14</a>. The Hindoos entertain the belief of a general deluge, not very dissimilar
to that of the Mosaic records. They admit, however, many such
catastrophes of the earth, and subsequent renovations through the creative
power of this attribute of Brahma, which they denominate Vishnu. The
Chank Shell refers to a deluge of the earth, anterior to that which seems to
accord with the sacred writ. The deliverance of the earth from the Mosaic
deluge they term the lotos creation, the type of which is the expanded
flower of the lotos, the indian <i>pedma</i> emerging above the surface of the waters
with Vishnu seated in its centre.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f15'>
<p class='c006'><a href='#r15'>15</a>. Were it requisite to treat more amply upon this subject, it would be
in our power to produce abundant evidence of the prevalence of this symbol
of the sacred Volute, wherever Vishnu or his delegated power appears.
The rich repository of the India House, the British Museum, and many
private collections afford us some examples of the most interesting kind.
Some few of these are so immediately connected with the object of our
enquiry, that we feel persuaded no apology will be necessary for their
introduction.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the collection of Lord Valentia is a four-sided cast in brass, resembling
a kind of pyramid, consisting of three low platforms, each bearing
idols, and surmounted at the summit by a tortoise. In several Indian
paintings mythologically adverting to the subject of the creation, the tortoise
is represented raising the new-born earth upon its back above the waters,
and it is usually seen in other mythological paintings of the same subject
bearing the throne upon which Vishnu is seated, while the attendants,
personified by various beings, are lifting the earth from the deep. Such a
painting was once in the celebrated collection of Colonel Stuart: and we
need no other evidence to shew that the bronze of Lord Valentia’s collection
is of the same mythological nature, and referable to the deluge, than to
observe the Chank Shell placed at each of the four corners of the ornament.
We may comprehend the allusion of the tortoise raising the earth from the
waters of the deluge, from a trait of the ancient Chinese astronomy; by the
tortoise bearing the earth, they intended the north pole of the ecliptic, which,
at the time of the deluge, they maintained had not materially changed its
position, and that by this means the world was sustained and saved from
utter annihilation.</p>

<p class='c006'>An Indian painting, mentioned by Mr. Edward Moor, the author of the
Hindoo Pantheon, presents us with another deity, Sivi, who holds the
Chank Shell in one of his four hands, and the antelope (moon) in another.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is also an Indian painting of Devi, who appears holding a Chank
Shell, furnished on each side with a lateral lappit or wing: this symbol he
holds in one hand, and the wheel, the emblem of the universe, in the other;
and in a bronze of Vishnu, in the India House, we find the Chank Shell
ornamented in a similar manner.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have seen another indian painting, in which, not only the Chank
Shell is furnished on each side with alæ, or wings, but an expanded flower
of six petals is placed upon its pinnacle. This shell, if we may judge from
its outline, is of that kind which has the spire depressed. Lord Valentia is
in possession of a bronze cast, in which Vishnu appears reclined upon his
couch of serpents, attended by <i>Lakshmi</i> and <i>Satyavama</i>, (eternity) in which
the shell is also winged, and appears to be of that kind in which the beak is
elongated or produced; and if this conjecture be correct, it will appear that
the Hindoos venerate indiscriminately, and probably as the same shell, each
of those three varieties of Voluta Pyrum, which we have mentioned in another
part of this description. Our limits will only permit us to observe that we
believe we may add with some degree of certainty, that the reversed shell,
the more immediate object of our present dissertation, may sometimes
appear also: there is in the temple of <i>Visweswara</i>, at Benares, a sculpture
of Surya, the Indian personification of the sun, seated in his chariot driven
by Aruna, in which the <i>Chank Shell</i> held in his right hand appears to have
the aperture on the left side instead of the right, as in the usual growth of
the shell. If this be not an oversight of the copyist (<i>Mr. Moor</i>) the circumstance
deserves peculiar notice.</p>

from those of the Linnæan Genus Turbo, and consequently not from Scalaria
of Lamarck and Cuvier, as must be concluded from their admission of Turbo
Clathratus among the number of its species, in an arrangement founded on
the organization of the animal, as well as its testaceous habitation. Cuvier
himself observes that the animal of the Vermet, and also the opening (of the
shell) resemble those of the Turbo, but that the whorls do not touch, and are
in part irregularly curved like the tubes of the Serpulas.—<cite>Règne Animal

<p class='c006'><a href='#r24'>24</a>. We learn from Labillardière, one of the Naturalists attached to the
expedition of Admiral Bruni d’Entrecasteaux, who went in search of
La Perouse in 1791, 1792, 1793, that this report is true. When the French
ships <i>Recherche</i> and <i>Espérance</i> touched at Tongataboo, there happened to
be peace between them and Fidgi, and as usual when they are not at war, a
considerable commerce was at that time carried on between them. This
brought Vouacecee, one of the chiefs of Fidgi, to Tongataboo soon after the
French had cast anchor, and as he paid them frequently a visit, they were
able to collect from him some useful information. Vouacecee represented
Fidgi to be very high land, of great fertility and lying distant in the north
west direction about seventy-two <i>myriametres</i>. The myriametre reduced to
our standard is six miles, one furlong, one hundred and fifty-six yards, and
six inches, giving in total value about one hundred and forty-nine leagues,
or four hundred and forty-seven miles. In the most favourable weather
with the large double canoe the voyage to Fidgi from thence could not be
less than three days, and when they had to struggle against the south winds
they must ply to windward upwards of a month. The people of Tongataboo
told them the people of Fidgi were cannibals: Vouacecee strove to exculpate
himself by answering that it was only the <i>touas</i>, or people of the lowest
class, who eat human flesh. But the assurances of the natives of Tongataboo
were fully confirmed in other quarters, and Labillardière who observes they
devour their enemies to satiate their fury, is entirely satisfied the chiefs as
well as touas are <i>Anthrophagi</i>. These people, notwithstanding this atrocity,
are represented as being far more advanced in arts and industry than the
people of other islands, who receive from them in time of peace many articles
of ingenious workmanship and produce of their island, and it is, no
doubt, by this means that the <i>Orange Cowry</i> has been introduced among
the natives of Otaheite and other islands in those seas.</p>

<p class='c006'>Besides its being satisfactory to ascertain beyond any doubt the habitat
of the Orange Cowry, the Conchologist is assured that other shells of the

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
